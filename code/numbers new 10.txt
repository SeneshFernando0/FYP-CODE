Después, un deslumbrador descubrimiento de su intimidad la transformará de nuevo en Clara Ribalta. Las afueras de Dios trata del itinerario físico y espiritual de esa mujer, que vive y ama hasta la muerte y más allá. El amor es el alimento único de su cuerpo y de su alma, ya que ambos son inseparablemente ella. El amor en muchas de sus manifestaciones: el divino, con su noche oscura, y también el humano; el que asciende a las cumbres más altas y el que se entrega con la entrega del cuerpo; el amor franciscano a todas las criaturas y, sobre los demás, el amor a los ancianos, que configura su vida entera. Su experiencia, en el convento y fuera de él, le ha permitido comprender que es imposible amar a los hombres en Dios: hay que amar a Dios en los hombres; que los otros no son el infierno: los otros son precisamente Dios. Y le ha permitido llegar a la conclusión de que la ciencia añade años a la vida humana, pero no añade vida a tales años, y ésa es la empresa en la que todos, por nuestro propio interés, hemos de participar. Y le ha permitido intuir que nuestro universo no fue creado de una vez para siempre; que ha de recrearse sin cesar por el hombre, habitante de las afueras de Dios pero su delegado y su continuador: la promesa «Seréis como Dioses» del Tentador en el Paraíso no fue una vana falacia. La primera parte de esta historia la relata el capellán del asilo cordobés. La segunda, pasados casi treinta años, un voluntario que trabaja en la residencia donde Clara es ya una anciana muy poco común. Situada en esas afueras, se mueve Clara a los impulsos de su corazón. Hasta que, al fin, le es dado conocer y saborear una aproximación indecible a lo que constituye el verdadero centro de su mundo, a su última e inefable razón de ser.

 id : 234029 ISBN : 0807031429  | name : In Schools We Trust  |  description : We are in an era of radical distrust of public education. Increasingly, we turn to standardized tests and standardized curricula-now adopted by all fifty states-as our national surrogates for trust. Legendary school founder and reformer Deborah Meier believes fiercely that schools have to win our faith by showing they can do their job. But she argues just as fiercely that standardized testing is precisely the wrong way to that end. The tests themselves, she argues, cannot give the results they claim. And in the meantime, they undermine the kind of education we actually want. In this multilayered exploration of trust and schools, Meier critiques the ideology of testing and puts forward a different vision, forged in the success stories of small public schools she and her colleagues have created in Boston and New York. These nationally acclaimed schools are built, famously, around trusting teachers-and students and parents-to use their own judgment. Meier traces the enormous educational value of trust; the crucial and complicated trust between parents and teachers; how teachers need to become better judges of each others' work; how race and class complicate trust at all levels; and how we can begin to 'scale up' from the kinds of successes she has created.

Sustainable agriculture, organic farming, urban gardens, smaller farms, animal traction and biological pest control are part of the successful paradigm shift underway in the Cuban countryside. In this book Cuban authors offer details-for the first time in English-of these remarkable achievements, which may serve as guideposts toward healthier, more environmentally friendly and self-reliant farming in countries both North and South."--Publisher's description

 id : 234054 ISBN : 0911226214  | name : A Soprano on Her Head  |  description : Eloise Ristad deals here with complex problems which torment and cripple so many of our most creative and talented people, and she does so with compassion, wisdom, and wit. The problem of stage fright, for instance, is a suffering of epidemic proportions in our society, and involves modalities of thought and projections that rob spontaneity and enthusiasm in artistic performance. Those interested in creative education have long felt that an entirely new, holistic and nurturing process of allowing individuals to discover and express themselves is needed if our educational system is to avoid the neuroses and creative blocks of the past generation. This book illuminates through its conversational style the destructive inhibitions, fears, and guilt experienced by all of us as we fail to break through to creativity. This story is told to me day after day in conservatories and college campuses around the world. Indeed I felt at times that she was telling of my own most petty and debilitating fears. But what is important, A Soprano on Her Head supplies answers and methods for overcoming these universal psychological blocks--methods that have not only been proven in her own studio, but which trace back through history to the oldest and wisest systems of understanding the integration of mind and body. The work bears scrutiny both scientifically and holistically. - Foreword.
 id : 234055 ISBN : 1565846346  | name : Rich Media, Poor Democracy  |  description : The first paperback edition of a myth-breaking book on media, from one of today's most reputable and insightful media historian/critics. Winner of Harvard's Goldsmith Book Prize, Rich Media, Poor Democracy challenges the assumption that a society drenched in commercial information "choices" is a democratic one. Robert McChesney, whom Marc Crispin Miller calls "the greatest of our media historians," argues that the major beneficiaries of the so-called Information Age are wealthy investors, advertisers, and a handful of enormous media, computer, and telecommunications corporations. This concentrated corporate control, McChesney maintains, is disastrous for any notion of participatory democracy. Combining unprecedented detail on current events with historical sweep, in a book Noam Chomsky calls a "rich and penetrating study," McChesney chronicles the waves of media mergers and acquisitions in the late 1990s. He reviews the corrupt and secretive enactment of public policies surrounding the internet, digital television, and public broadcasting. He also addresses the gradual and ominous adaptation of the First Amendment as a means of shielding corporate media power and the wealthy, and he debunks the myth that the market compels media firms to "give the people what they want." In an eye-opening call to action, McChesney warns that we must organize politically to restructure the media if we want democracy to endure.

 id : 234098 ISBN : 0609606239  | name : Knight of the Sacred Lake  |  description : As High King and Queen, Arthur and Guenevere reign supreme across the many kingdoms and islands of Great Britain. Reconciled with Arthur, Guenevere secretly mourns the loss of her beloved Lancelot, who has returned to the Sacred Lake of his boyhood, hoping to restore his faith in chivalry in the place where he first learned to be a knight. In a glittering ceremony at the annual feast of Pentecost, new knights are sworn to the Round Table, including Arthur's nephews, the cunning Agravain and his heroic brother Gawain. Camelot is reborn in all its glory, and after many years of strife, peace is restored to Guenevere's realm. But betrayal, jealousy, and ancient blood feuds fester unseen. Morgan Le Fay, now the proud possessor of Arthur's only son, Mordred, has become the focus of Merlin's age-old quest to ensure the survival of the house of Pendragon at all costs. And from the east comes the shattering news that Guenevere may have a rival for Lancelot's love. A bleak shadow falls again across Camelot--and across the sacred isle of Avalon, where Roman priests threaten the sanctity of the Hallows and the life of the Lady herself. At the center of the storm is Guenevere, a proud and powerful queen torn between her love for her husband, her people, and her knight, Sir Lancelot of the Lake. With rare and intuitive magic, Rosalind Miles brings to life a legendary woman's bravery and passion, and all the pageantry, heartbreak, violence, and beauty of an age gone by.

 id : 234130 ISBN : 0471347795  | name : The Good, the Bad, and Your Business  |  description : Does the need to make a profit outweigh the need to reward employees fairly? Should you tell your staff why you fired someone and risk being sued for defamation? Is it more important to make payroll or pay your vendors? Business professionals face ethical decisions like these every day. Such dilemmas will keep even the most seasoned managers tossing and turning at night. You can rest assured that at some point in your career you'll be faced with making, or witness the making of, an ethical decision-and the action you take will not only define you, but also what your company stands for. The pressure to make the right choices is incredible; indecision or one small misstep can be the kiss of death in today's highly competitive, fast-moving economy. Productivity can drop off, employee morale can plummet, dissatisfied customers can flee, and your competitor may take a large bite out of your profits-while the dilemma remains unsolved. The Good, The Bad, and Your Business shows companies how to run more efficiently by improving their navigation of everyday moral business dilemmas. Respected writer and journalist Jeffrey Seglin reveals how otherwise decent people can make mistakes and find themselves in serious ethical trouble. His practical approach uses real-life examples to help you see the difference between a "gray area" and an outright misdeed so you can act faster when faced with such ethical decisions. Without being preachy or theoretical, The Good, The Bad, and Your Business looks at how others have faced moral dilemmas and gives you the tools to help you reach your own decisions. You'll see firsthand how businesspeople have grappled with difficult issues, from how to draw the line between lying and posturing, to whether it's ever ethical to spy on competitors, to how to align personal beliefs with business practices. You'll also discover the common misperceptions about ethics in business and learn how to define your "comfort" level so that you can conduct business knowing you've made thoughtful decisions with full knowledge of the possible consequences. The Good, The Bad, and Your Business: * Looks at how company owners and managers make difficult decisions as they try to keep cash flow strong enough to stay in business * Examines how to deal with employee issues, from how far to go to help a troubled employee to what policy-if any-to take on romantic relationships between coworkers * Reveals the motivations that lie behind how people decide where to "draw the line" on what they will and will not do * Focuses on how the decisions you make can affect the common good-the larger community in which you're doing business "Well-written and lucid, this book does not preach; it teaches the reader how to think intelligently about hard choices. Every executive who wants to build a successful business and wants to do so with integrity-should read this book."-Jim Collins, Coauthor, Built to Last "It's a rare business book that can truly change your life, and Jeff Seglin's latest is just that. You'll find no grandstanding or buzzwords, but rather a compelling blend of research and worldly experience, written by a master. He's the perfect travel guide for the examined life we all must lead to achieve meaningful success. Don't miss this one!"-Steven Leveen, Cofounder and President, Levenger "Finally a book about modern ethics and business that you don't have to get all dressed up to read! Writing with a sure touch, lively language, and a wonderful wit . . . Jeff Seglin has found a way to wake up his subject without once getting bogged down. He never lectures . . . he knows his stuff and he respects his readers' intelligence. This terrific book is the next best thing to talking to your smart, warm, and funny best friend about the toughest decisions you'll ever have to make. It's flat-out superb."-Nancy K. Austin, Coauthor, A Passion for Excellence
 id : 234131 ISBN : 0758207689  | name : Home to Italy  |  description : In this delightful, moving debut novel, Peter Pezzelli brings to life the earthy sensuality of Tuscany-- the smell of just-baked bread wafting through the village piazza; the shopkeepers sweeping the sidewalks under the warm, early morning sun; groups of cyclists dotting the mountain roads--and spins a story of May-December romance as sharp and delicious as the olives of Villa San Giuseppe. . . Sometimes You Have To Travel Far To Find Your Way Home. After the death of his beloved wife, Anna, Peppi's family and friends expect him to bury his grief by tending to his gardens and taking long rides on his bike. Instead, Peppi shocks them all with his decision to return to Villa San Giuseppe, the small Italian village where he spent his childhood, and to il mulino, his family's old mill. But once he's back, he temporarily moves into an apartment over the candy factory run by his childhood best friend, Luca. It is modest, but livable, with a lovely view of Luca's neglected gardens and his equally neglected daughter, the fiery Lucrezia. More a force of nature than a woman, Lucrezia's legendary temper and workaholic schedule hide the very real pain she feels over her husband's death years before. At first, she tolerates Peppi as an eccentric annoyance--her father's strange but handsome American friend who fixes things around the factory and is bringing the gardens back to life. But soon, Lucrezia's interest in Peppi deepens. Like a high wind, the gossip is flying through Villa San Giuseppe--Lucrezia's making it to dinner on time. She's eating olives from a man's hand. She's wearing heels. Now, under the warm Tuscan sun, a tentative romance begins to bloom between the grieving pair, yielding to a surprisingly strong passion with the power to heal life's wounds and promise second chances. . .
 id : 234132 ISBN : 0060989025  | name : The Water and the Blood  |  description : I turned and faced the road we'd come down, my face hard and set. The kids moved on without me. I could still see a slight glow and the murky, gray smoke reaching above the trees, where it spread to the south.... When I thought they were out of earshot, I took a deep breath. "You lied to me," I whispered toward the building, to all the people it represented, to the hours I'd spent on those hard, split-log seats, and to my childish epiphanies born there .... "You lied," I said. "These are my best friends now." Rare is the gift of a writer who is able to conjure up the voices of very different worlds, to give them heat and power and make them sing. Such is the talent of Nancy E. Turner. Her beloved first novel, These Is My Words, opened readers to the challenges of a woman's life in the nineteenth-century Southwest. Now this extraordinary writer shifts her gaze to a very different world -- East Texas in the years of the Second World War -- and to the life of a young woman named Philadelphia Summers, known against her will as Frosty. From the novel's harrowing opening scene, Frosty's eyes survey the landscape around her -- white rural America -- with the awestruck clarity of an innocent burned by sin. In her mother and sisters she sees fear and small-mindedness; in the eyes of local boys she sees racial hatred and hunger for war. When that war finally comes, it offers her a chance for escape -to California, and the caring arms of Gordon Benally a Native-American soldier. But when she returns to Texas she must face the rejection of a town still gripped by suspicion -- and confront the memory of the crime that has marked her soul since adolescence. Propelled by the quiet power of one woman's voice, The Water and the Blood is a moving and unforgettable portrait of an America of haunted women and dangerous fools -- an America at once long perished and with us still.

 id : 234137 ISBN : 0609608428  | name : If I Live to be 100  |  description : If I Live to Be 100 is a remarkable book, beautifully written and elegantly wise, that takes us inside the world of the very old and invites us to learn from them firsthand the art of living well for an exceptionally long period of time. Neenah Ellis always wanted to live to 100, and her fascination led her to interview centenarians from all over the country about what life was like at the very beginning of the century, and how things have changed over time. Ellis, a producer for National Public Radio, spent an unforgettable year traveling with her tape recorder and listening to the stories of America's oldest men and women. She met a couple who courted by horse and sleigh in Vermont during the winter of 1918, and she spent a week with the oldest living black lesbian in America. She visited a nationally known expert on dyslexia who published a book at 96 and whose great-great-grandfather was a colonel in Washington's army; and she met Anna Wilmot, the row-boating centenarian from New England who captured the hearts of thousands of NPR listeners with her confession that she swims in the buff only "when it's foggy and there's no fisherman around." Originally conceived as an American history project, Ellis's year of interviews became much more, a personal journey of growth and transformation. After two decades of acting as the reporter and inquisitor, Ellis finally shifted gears and was able in the process of these conversations to start really listening. Once she had put away the exigencies of her cusp-of-the-millennium life--her deadlines, the intense focus on current events, the endless e-mail and ringing phones --she began to learn the kinds of things that we do from much olderpeople. She started to connect in her conversations with them, and to see the virtue of looking forward, as the centenarians did, not backward. They reminded her that the moment--this very moment that we're in right now--is precious and fine. And that the true richness of life is to be found in each other--in our marriages and friendships, in the intellectual life that we share with each other, and in the ways that we become connected. Their stories add up to a course in living well, with lessons and inspiration for all of us.

 id : 234175 ISBN : 1401352197  | name : Sammy's Hill  |  description : "The fact that I had managed to become a health-care analyst for a U.S. Senator at the age of twenty-six still surprised me, and I lived in fear that someone would realize how ridiculous it was to have given me this authority and fire me on the spot." Idealistic, dedicated to her job, and a bit of a hypochondriac, Samantha Joyce has a very busy life. Working a seventy-hour week and mastering the details of the latest health-care reform bill, while making time to celebrate obscure but significant holidays such as the twenty-ninth anniversary of The Partridge Family series finale, leaves little time for romance. But then she meets Aaron Driver, the handsome speechwriter for a rival senator. Sammy falls for him hard, despite the fact that his ambitious boss is the emblem of everything she hates about congressional hardball. When you work on Capitol Hill, even dating becomes a political act. Try as she might, Sammy isn't the sort of person who can keep from speaking her mind, no matter how much trouble it causes. Whether she's trying to thwart a filibuster, detox a constituent, or recover from mistakenly emailing a racy message to over two hundred of Capitol Hill's political elite, Sammy stays true to herself, foibles and all. And before she knows it, she finds herself at the heart of a romantic tangle, a major showdown over health care reform, and the highest-stakes contest of alla presidential election campaign. Kristin Gore is a keen observer of politics with a sharp ear for comedy, and her first novel is a triumpha captivating, hilarious page-turner with a loveable heroine who will charm readers on both sides of the aisle.

Reviewers compare his books to hurricanes and firestorms, descriptions that are especially apt in the case of Time of the Assassins. The most controversial story in today's inner cities is the CIA's apparent funding of counterinsurgent druglords in Latin America, who, instead of fighting revolutionaries, have used that funding to wholesale crack cocaine in this country's ghettos. In this exciting new novel, Commander Larry Cole battles these Agency-funded druglords. Their "personal representative" is Baron von Rianocek, a hitman. A well-paid professional, known as a world-class "problem solver," he has successfully eliminated both high-profile British industrialists and South American dictators. The CIA, the FBI, and Interpol, all suspect him of being behind various incidents, but they have never been able to pin anything on the slippery millionaire, who claims to be descended from European royalty. Police detective Larry Cole has unwittingly crossed paths several times with the notorious assassin. Appearing at the wrong place at the wrong time, he had twice foiled the assassin's work. Now the well-heeled assassin has a new target. He has set his telescopic sights on the CPD chief of detectives-Cole himself.

 id : 234181 ISBN : 037543058X  | name : Omerta  |  description : Don Raymonde Aprile is an old man, wily enough to retire gracefully from organized crime after a lifetime of ruthless conquest. His three children have grown up to become respectable members of the establishment. To protect them from harm, and to keep an eye on his group of international banks, Don Aprile has adopted a "nephew" from Sicily, Astorre Viola, whose previous legal guardian made the unfortunate decision of committing suicide in the trunk of a car. Don Aprile's retirement is viewed with suspicion by Kurt Clike, the FBI's special agent in charge of investigating the Mafia. Clike has achieved remarkable success in breaking down the bonds among families, cultivating high-ranking sources, who, in return for federal protection, have violated omerta-Italian for "code of silence." As Clike and the FBI mount their campaign to wipe out the Mafia once and for all, Astorre Viola nd the Apriles find themselves in the midst of one last war, a conflict in which it is hard to distinguish who is on the right side of the law, and whether mercy or vengeance is the best course of action. Rich with suspense, dark humor, and larger-than-life characters who have turned Mario Puzo's novels into modern myths, OMERTA is a powerful epitaph for the Mafia at the century's end and a final triumph for a great American storyteller.

 id : 234343 ISBN : 1566398304  | name : Yellow Journalist  |  description : "For three decades, William Wong has been America's most energetic and entertaining chronicler of the Asian diaspora and its effects on politics, culture, business, sports, dress, diet, and language. Like other great humorists, he exposes the painful absurdities that plague each new wave of immigrant families as they enrich the national character, from Wong's own adventurous parents to Tiger Woods. Some of these pieces offer surprising insights on geopolitics and others explore the legal and social consequences of racial discrimination, but my favorites are the playful essays, including the classic 'So That's Why I Can't Lose Weight.' " --Jay Mathews, Washington Post reporter and columnist, and author of Class Struggle Who are Asian Americans? Are they the remnants of the "yellow peril" portrayed in the media through stories on Asian street gangs, unscrupulous political fundraisers, and crafty nuclear spies? Or are they the "model minority" that the media present as consistently outranking European Americans in math scores and violin performances? In this funny, sobering, and always enlightening collection, journalist William Wong comments on these and other anomalies of the Asian American experience. From its opening tribute to the Oakland Chinatown of Wong's childhood to its closing tribute to Tiger Woods, Yellow Journalist portrays the many-sided legacies of exclusion and discrimination. The stories, columns, essays, and commentaries in this collection tackle such persistent problems as media racism, criminality, inter-ethnic tensions, and political marginalization. As a group, they make a strong case for the centrality of the Asian American historical experiences in U.S. race relations. The essays cover many subjects, from the personal to policy, from the serious to the silly. You will learn a little Asian American history and a lot about the nuances and complexities of the contemporary Asian American experience. If there is an overriding theme of these stories and essays, it is the multi-faceted adaptation of ethnic Asians to the common American culture, the intriguing roles that they play in our society, and the quality of their achievements to contribute to a better society. Bill Wong's high school journalism teacher took him aside during his senior year and told him he would have to be "twice as good" to succeed at his chosen profession. Succeed he did, and "twice as good" he is. As Darrell Hamamoto remarks in his Foreword, "'Chinaman,' Chinese American, Asian American; any way you slice it, Bill Wong is one straight-up righteous Yellow Man." "One of the advantages of having a writer of Bill Wong's talent around is that we don't have to depend upon intermediaries and go-betweens to give us insights about issues affecting Asian-Americans. He is often entertaining, and ironic, but underneath it all is a serious mind devoted to shattering myths about one of our fastest growing minorities." --Ishmael Reed, author of The Reed Reader "It is about time that America meet William Wong--an icon in journalism whose experience as a second generation Chinese-American has given him a unique lens through which life in America can be examined. For almost two decades, his columns in the Oakland Tribune and other San Francisco bay area newspapers have captured a different kind of reality about some of our most important social, cultural, and political moments. Wong's readiness to share his family, his community, and his conscience allows readers to cross a bridge into the world of Asian America. Whether it is an analysis of the 1996 campaign finance scandals or a perspective on how parent pressures and bi-cultural conflicts can play out in a young Asian American teen's life, Wong's skillful weaving of humor, irony, and poignant portrayals of the circumstances make each story linger long past the final sentence of his essay." --Angela E. Oh, Lecturer/Former Advisory Board Member, President's Initiative on Race "...an anthology of Wong's best writing from the last decade and a half, covering an impressive array of topics and tone." --Asianweek

Readers of the spellbinding story of Mary Newbury can finally find out what happens to her next - thanks to a young, modern-day descendant who has an uncanny connection to the past. Agnes closed her eyes in the heat and steam of the sweat lodge. She woke to air that was dry and cold around her. She was no longer Agnes, or even Karonhisake, Searching Sky. She was no longer American or Haudenosaunee. She was English, and her name was Mary, and she woke to find that she was dying, freezing to death. It came to Agnes unbidden - a vision of Mary Newbury, alone in the snow, dying of the cold. A vision of a young woman who had lived in the 1600s, an unusual young woman who had been driven from her Puritan settlement, accused of being a witch. It was an image of a woman whose life was about to change radically, as she embarked on an existence that defied all accepted norms - embracing passionate independence, love, and loyalty to a proud, endangered community that accepted her as one of their own. Marys and Agness lives have been separated by almost 400 years, but they are inextricably linked by more than blood. Like Mary, Agnes has special powers - powers that Mary now seeks to ensure that the rest of her story is told.

But Basin City needed a town-taming marshal, and a cold-blooded murderer was hiding behind Hayness real name. Now Haynes was coming out of hiding to protect his honor, save a town, and catch a killereven if it cost him his life. Lou Morgan was as tough as they came. But it wasnt just the money or the challenge that motivated him to take on a suicide job involving a buried Spanish treasure and two greedy killers. It was love for a beautiful señorita who had left him for dead years ago. Its not easy being the new schoolmaam in town . . . especially when youre a man. But Van Brady isnt quite the tenderfoot he seems, and before hes through hell teach a few hard cases a lesson theyll never forget. From the rough-and-tumble streets of San Francisco to the dry desert plains of Texas, from a roughshod gambler willing to wager his own life on a single bet to a killer with a heart, here are stirring tales of the Old West as only Louis LAmour can write them, tales of men and women risking their lives, fighting their wars, and standing tall on the American frontier.

 id : 234424 ISBN : 0375503765  | name : Love Works Like this  |  description : "Is even the most clenched heart capable of it?" Lauren Slater asks about love, in this original, eloquent, and illuminating book about how we discover what love truly is. Slater, career-oriented and willfully autonomous, charts her own personal journey and decision-making process, starting with a list of the pros and cons, about having a child. The cons are many, the pros only one: "learning a new kind of love." But what will that love look like? How does one reconcile the needs of the self with the demands of others? How do couples go from the dyad that is a marriage to the triad that is a family? And how can Slater adjust to losing precious control of her own carefully developed life? Slater's complex biological and psychological history also lies at the core of this unique and yet strikingly universal story. One of the first people ever to take Prozac, she chronicles the impossibly conflicting advice regarding pregnancy and antidepressants, and explains the rationale behind her eventual decision to stop taking the medication during her first trimester. This is Slater's first encounter with self-sacrifice, and for her a crossroad at which modern medicine and basic human love meet. Love Works Like This is a richly written book by "an enormously poetic and ebullient writer" (Elle magazine), an author who writes with "beauty and bravery" (Los Angeles Times Book Review) about falling in love, about growing into the ability to put someone else's life ahead of your own, and about the rich rewards we can draw from the courage to exchange one kind of happy life for another.

Mais on n'échappe pas à ses névroses, et leurs échanges pleins de sous-entendus - et de malentendus - les ramènent sans cesse, comme le ressac hostile de la mer, à la rencontre de leur solitude. Alice Thomas Ellis entraîne le lecteur dans un étrange territoire littéraire, entre comédie humaine (côté terre) et roman fantastique (côté mer).
 id : 234468 ISBN : 2070419886  | name : La sale guerre  |  description : " J'ai vu des collègues brûler vif un enfant de quinze ans. J'ai vu des soldats se déguiser en terroristes et massacrer des civils. J'ai vu des colonels assassiner, de sang-froid, de simples suspects. J'ai vu des officiers torturer, à mort, des islamistes. J'ai vu trop de choses. Autant d'atteintes à la dignité humaine que je ne saurais taire. Ce sont là des raisons suffisantes, j'en suis convaincu, pour briser le mur du silence. " Pour la première fois, à visage découvert, un officier des troupes spéciales de l'armée algérienne raconte au jour le jour, depuis 1992, la " sale guerre " qui déchire son pays. Un coin du voile se lève sur l'un des tabous les mieux gardés du drame algérien : le fonctionnement interne de l'armée. Ce témoignage exceptionnel a eu un grand retentissement.

 id : 234470 ISBN : 2070420493  | name : La machine-école  |  description : La machine-école : qui se soucie vraiment, dans les débats sur l'école, de la réalité de l'Education nationale, de cette machine qui avance, mais broie, fabrique, mais rejette, relève de réglages délicats entre les politiques, les enseignants, les parents, voire les élèves ? L'ouvrage de Philippe Meirieu - qui répond aux questions de Stéphanie Le Bars, journaliste au Monde - n'est pas un livre de plus sur l'école, mais une coupe anatomique du système de l'Education nationale. Il n'est pas question ici de la seule réaffirmation de grands principes, mais de leur application de plus en plus difficile dans le cambouis quotidien d'une machine prisonnière des corporatismes enseignants, du consumérisme des parents, de la volonté, sans lendemain ni suivi, des ministres de laisser leur nom à des réformes dont ils ne verront pas les suites ni n'assumeront les échecs éventuels. Philippe Meirieu, longtemps tenu par la presse pour le conseiller occulte de Claude Allègre, est aujourd'hui chargé par Jack Lang de réfléchir à la réforme des Instituts universitaires de formation des maîtres ; il fut la cible de virulentes campagnes de presse ad hominem de la part de publicistes ou d'intellectuels brandissant haut les principes de la République. Il explique ici comment ne pas laisser, sous couvert des grands principes, les inégalités - sociales, économiques, culturelle - créer une école à deux vitesses.

 id : 234472 ISBN : 2070417492  | name : Vichy, L Evene Memo L His  |  description : La 4e de couverture indique : "Plus que d'autres, les historiens le savent : le pouvoir des mots peut aussi être celui de la confusion. Lorsqu'on parle de Vichy, il convient désormais de préciser si l'on entend : le régime installé avec l'ambition de conduire en profondeur, dans un pays occupé, une " Révolution nationale " ; le gouvernement et son administration dont la mémoire nationale, ces dernières décennies, privilégie le souvenir de la déportation des juifs ; ou l'objet de recherches menées par des historiens et dont la perspective globale sur l'époque diverge de plus en plus de celle que nourrit la justice. C'est à une traversée de ces trois acceptions qu'invite l'ouvrage d'Henry Rousso, reflet de plus de vingt ans de recherches et de travaux consacrés aussi bien à l'impact de l'événement sur la société (à travers l'économie, la politique et la culture), qu'à la postérité de l'événement (du bilan des épurations militaires, civiles et administratives au sortir de la guerre jusqu'aux tentatives contemporaines de juger ce passé dans les prétoires). Une réflexion, en quelque sorte, sur les manières d'écrire l'histoire contemporaine comme sur les usages qu'en font les générations successives."

Commissioned by a billionaire corporate chief to study the causes of the rising tide of global violence and social unrest, they begin to fear that a kind of disease is behind it all. They christen this the Babel Effect. Could there be a biomedical explanation for a kind of global insanity? Or is something else at the root of the problem? The investigation is brutally interrupted when Jessamine is kidnapped, and in the face of opposition from sinister and powerful organisations, Ryan McCloud grows increasingly desperate to find a way of halting the contagion of the Babel Effect, before it's too late for his family - before it's too late for mankind.
 id : 234479 ISBN : 2070324494  | name : Syllogismes de l'amertume  |  description : Syllogismes de l'amertume se présente sous l'aspect fragmenté d'un recueil de pensées, tour à tour graves ou cocasses. Rien pourtant de moins " dispersé " que ce livre. Du premier au dernier paragraphe, une même obsession s'affirme : celle de conserver au doute le double privilège de l'anxiété et du sourire. Alors que dans son premier essai, Précis de décomposition, Cioran s'attaquait à l'immédiat ou à l'inactuel avec une rage lyrique, dans celui-ci il promène sur notre époque, sur l'histoire et sur l'homme, un regard détaché où la révolte cède le pas à l'humour, à une sorte de sérénité dans l'ahurissement. Ce sont là propos d'un Job assagi à l'école des moralistes.

Parallèlement à ce Hard-boiled wonderland, interviennent en alternance les chapitres de La Fin des temps : le narrateur se trouve prisonnier d'une ville onirique, peuplée de licornes au pelage doré. Les deux intrigues se rejoindront finalement. De même que son personnage flirte avec d'anodines jeunes filles, Haruki Murakami courtise ici le mythe - ce qui nous vaut une fable d'une prenante étrangeté.

 id : 234518 ISBN : 0819565008  | name : Recollecting from the Past  |  description : Studies interconnections between sound production, spirit possession, colonialism and ceremonial remembering in Madagascar. The first serious ethnomusicological study of Malagasy music, Recollecting from the Past evokes the complex sound and performative aesthetic in Madagascar called maresaka. Maresaka pertains not only to musical expression but extends into ways of remembering the past, aesthetics of everyday life, and Malagasy concepts of self and community. Ron Emoff focuses on tromba spirit possession ceremonies in which Malagasy use devotional practice as an occasion to expressively re-figure worlds often impeded by colonialism and postcolonial phenomena, extreme material poverty, and widespread illness. Malagasy not only preserve the past, but they interpret, revalue and transform it to their own ends. Music is crucial to these performances since powerful ancestral spirits will not enter into the present if not enticed by masterful musical performances, and so music itself provides a complex symbolic system with which Malagasy can recall and reconstruct the past. This groundbreaking study will be of interest to readers in the fields of anthropology, ethnomusicology, cultural studies, African studies, postcolonial and performance studies.

The yellow metal said brass, not gold, and the sparkly bits were certainly not diamonds. But the ring belonged to May's horseplaying uncle, who swore it brought good luck. Dortmunder, who wouldn't kick a little good luck out of bed, puts it to the test when he goes to burglarize Long Island billionaire Max Fairbanks. As luck would have it, Dortmunder is greeted by Fairbanks himself - and a loaded gun - as soon as he strolls through the door.

And as each woman, renowned and obscure, tells her remarkable personal story, it is clear that each has tapped into the power that comes from within and has reached back into a history that brings with it courage and hope. " 'Giving energy to Mother Earth' -- Yes. That is our duty as women, as Natives, and as human beings. Messengers of the Wind is a way of doing just that. It is not a dance, feet patting our mother, but it is an offering, the voices of the women sent to comfort her. Thank-you, Jane Katz, for your offering.

 id : 234666 ISBN : 1886913102  | name : Sarajevo Days, Sarajevo Nights  |  description : "Sarajevo Days, Sarajevo Nights is an extraordinary document of life deep inside one of the world's most war-ravaged regions." "Until the spring of 1992, when she was thirty, Elma Softic led a relatively ordinary, happy, middle-class life. She lived with her parents and sister, taught philosophy at a business college, and enjoyed the typical cafe life of a cosmopolitan city." "When the Serbs began bombing that spring, Elma began a diary, her attempt to bear what seemed increasingly unbearable, to stay focused while living in a state of siege. Eventually, she "got sick of it. The war was no longer something to put oneself out for." Rather, what she needed was a listener, someone to talk to about day to day life in Sarajevo. Through ham radio correspondence, she made new friends in Zagreb, who asked her to put her observations on paper in the form of open letters. It was these letters, first passed hand to hand, then reaching an ever-larger public in Croatia and throughout Europe, that created a sensation with their eloquent, sometimes stunning descriptions of modern life - a life not unlike our own - rendered primitive by war." "Published in Canada for the first time in English and now available to readers in the United States, Sarajevo Days, Sarajevo Nights is a collection of Elma's diaries and letters, dated April 1992 to June 1995. With a novelist's eye for detail and a natural storyteller's gift for narrative, she gives clear and compelling voice to a place, a conflict and a life that are, for the most part, unthinkable, unspeakable and unimaginable."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

 id : 234673 ISBN : 0813511097  | name : White by Definition  |  description : "An unusual and powerful study."--Eric R. Wolf, Herbert H. Lehman College, CUNY "A profound study of the nebulous Creoles. . . . Domínguez's use of original sources . . . is scholarship at its best. . . . Her study is fascinating, thought-provoking, controversial, and without a doubt, one of the most objective analyses of Creole Louisiana. Her emphasis on social stratification and her excellent integration of ethnic and racial classification of Creoles with legal and social dynamics and individual choice of ethnic identity elucidates strikingly the continuing controversy of who and what is a Louisiana Creole."--Journal of American Ethnic History "Domínguez's most important contribution lies in her conceptualization of the problem of identity. She treats ethnic identity as something that can change over time, warning us against imposing current meanings on the past and requiring us to consider evidence of how terms were actually used in the past. . . . It is hard to imagine a frame of reference more ideally suited to historical analysis."--Louisiana History "A valuable interdisciplinary examination of the processes of racial definition in Louisiana's history. Her study combines the anthropologist's sensitivity to language and self definition within a community with a skillful exploitation of historical sources."--Law and Society "I highly recommend this book to all persons interested in social stratification."--Alvin L. Bertrand, Contemporary Sociology "A vivid and insightful reading of the historical circumstances that have shaped definitions of Creoles within Louisiana law and society."--Journal of Southern History "A provocative, often brilliant book. It offers fresh perspectives on fundamental questions and deserves a wide readership among American social historians."--Journal of American History

 id : 234719 ISBN : 0375703314  | name : The Last King of Scotland  |  description : Shortly after his arrival in Uganda, Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan is called to the scene of a bizarre accident: Idi Amin, careening down a dirt road in his red Maserati, has run over a cow. When Garrigan tends to Amin, the dictator, in his obsession for all things Scottish, appoints him as his personal physician. And so begins a fateful dalliance with the central African leader whose Emperor Jones-style autocracy would transform into a reign of terror. In The Last King of Scotland Foden's Amin is as ridiculous as he is abhorrent: a grown man who must be burped like an infant, a self-proclaimed cannibalist who, at the end of his 8 years in power, would be responsible for 300,000 deaths. And as Garrigan awakens to his patient's baroque barbarism--and his own complicity in it--we enter a venturesome meditation on conscience, charisma, and the slow corruption of the human heart. Brilliantly written, comic and profound, The Last King of Scotland announces a major new talent.

 id : 234724 ISBN : 1585746843  | name : Living Wild and Domestic  |  description : The question of what constitutes effective health communication has been addressed mainly by scholars working in American and European cultural contexts. Many people who could benefit most from effective health communication, however, come from different cultures. A prime example is the threat posed by HIV/AIDS to the people of South Africa. Although it is generally acknowledged that health communication needs to be tailored to the target audience s characteristics with cultural background being one of the most salient ones, little research has been done on how to achieve this. In this book, we bring together leading scholars in the field of health communication as well as communication scholars from South Africa. As such, it can serve as an example of the promises and the limitations of general health communication theories to local praxis as well as provide guidelines for the development of better health communication in South Africa.

 id : 234737 ISBN : 0375507086  | name : Too Close to Call  |  description : From the best-selling author of A Vast Conspiracy and The Run of His Life comes Too Close to Call--the definitive story of the Bush-Gore presidential recount. A political and legal analyst of unparalleled journalistic skill, Jeffrey Toobin is the ideal writer to distill the events of the thirty-six anxiety-filled days that culminated in one of the most stunning Supreme Court decisions in history. Packed with news-making disclosures and written with the drive of a legal thriller, Too Close to Call takes us inside James Baker's private jet, through the locked gates to Al Gore's mansion, behind the covered-up windows of Katherine Harris's office, and even into the secret conference room of the United States Supreme Court. As the scene shifts from Washington to Austin and into the remote corners of the enduringly strange Sunshine State, Toobin's book will transform what you thought you knew about the most extraordinary political drama in American history. The Florida recount unfolded in a kaleidoscopic maze of bizarre concepts (chads, pregnant and otherwise), unfamiliar people in critically important positions (the Florida Supreme Court), and familiar people in surprising new places (the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez, in a previously undisclosed role in this melodrama). With the rich characterization that is his trademark, Toobin portrays the prominent strategists who masterminded the campaigns--the Daleys and the Roves--and also the lesser-known but influential players who pulled the strings, as well as the judges and justices whose decisions determined the final outcome. Toobin gives both camps a treatment they have not yet received--remarkably evenhanded, nonpartisan, andentirely new. The post-election period posed a challenge to even the most zealous news junkie: how to keep up with what was happening and sort out the important from the trivial. Jeffrey Toobin has now done this--and then some. With clarity, insight, humor, and a deep understanding of the law, he deconstructs the events, the players, and the often Byzantine intricacies of our judicial system. A remarkable account of one of the most significant periods in our country's history, Too Close to Call is endlessly surprising, frequently poignant, and wholly addictive.

 id : 234790 ISBN : 0911226273  | name : Using Your Brain--for a Change  |  description : Bandler covers a lot of ground in this book - in his unique style - and provides real insight into areas such as sub-modalities and multiple perspectives in a fairly short period (157 pages). The content is edited notes from a series of Bandler workshops (in a similar vein to Frogs into Princes and Trance-Formations). The book begins with an overview of NLP - making particular reference to the "new" submodality patterns (the book was written in 1985) and presenting these as a faster and more powerful way of creating personal change. Subsequent chapters provide a humorous exploration of many of the traditional approaches to personal change and outline many useful guiding principles (structure versus content etc) for the application of NLP to personal change. The author makes repeated reference to a number of epistemological issues underlying traditional psychological approaches that tend to focus on "what's wrong, when you broke, ... what broke you, ... and why you broke." He goes on to state that "psychologists have never been interested in how you broke, or how you continue to maintain the state of being broken." NLP on the other hand, Bandler asserts, assumes people work perfectly and that people are just doing something different from what we (or they) want to have happen. This provides a clear indication of the approach adopted in the remainder of the book, and suggests that the focus of NLP on subjective experience (as the study of subjective experience) is entirely valid and necessary. Bandler provides a convincing argument for tailoring all our change work to the individual - purely because each individual is unique. The book continues with a useful and insightful exploration of a number of techniques (including the fast phobia cure, contrastive analysis in belief change, integrated anchors and Swish,) as well as discussion of more general (and generative) strategies for learning and motivation.
 id : 234793 ISBN : 0743406990  | name : Soul Trade  |  description : Some people collect baseball cards, some people collect Beanie Babies... some people collect souls. A vision of a young girl in pain leads Angel, Doyle and Cordelia to the scene just moments too late - the girl of the vision is being taken unconscious to hospital. The only clue as to what could have happened to her is an ornate glass vial found at the foot of her bed, which Doyle recognises as used for the containment of human souls. It seems souls have many uses (other than the obvious): no two are alike, and the soul of an innocent child is one of the most eagerly sought-after items on the demonic black market. Angel knows the value of a human soul, for his is the source of his own salvation. But can he find this young girl's in time to save her? Nor is she the only one in danger. For no sooner has Angel made his presence known than the demonic dealers in souls realise that there's another soul out there which is quite literally priceless...a soul more unique than they could ever have dared to dream...

The priest lapses into a coma. Doyle is wracked by visions of a young mother and her son in danger, down by the dockside. Cordelia finds herself on the trail of a film producer's missing wife. It is up to Angel to find the connection between them before he is stopped by the phantom whose touch brings death...and all of them are running out of time.

Have you been transformed by His furious, passionate, unexplainable love? Join Brennan Manning, the bestselling author of The Ragamuffin Gospel, on a personal journey to experience Christs love and live with His passion.

It was a gift, and it seemed to me as if I knew the Giver." --Henry Van Dyke Long, long ago, a wise man named Artaban, a priest of the Magi, discerned from heavenly signs that the time was at hand for the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy--the birth among the Hebrews of a holy Prince and Deliverer of Man. Hastening to join three fellow Magi for the long journey into Judaea, he paused to help a dying man and was left behind. And so Artaban began his pilgrimage alone, striking out not toward the realization of his life's deepest longing, as he hoped, but only toward misfortune and suffering. Or so he believed until one blessed, radiant moment. With an introduction by Leo Buscaglia

Only when these are evident in our lives will the world know that we are Christians.

 id : 235077 ISBN : 157441139X  | name : Minding the Store  |  description : "'There is never a good sale for Neiman Marcus unless it's a good buy for the customer.' That was one of the first declarations of business philosophy I heard my father, Herbert Marcus, make soon after I came to work at Neiman Marcus in 1926." Thus began the 1974 edition of Minding the Store. Reprinted in hardcover in 1997 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Neiman Marcus, it is now available for the first time in paperback. Mr. Marcus spent most of his life not only in helping to create a retailing enterprise renowned throughout the world as the epitome of quality, but also in setting high standards for the level of taste of all who desire "the better things in life." In doing so he has played a key role in making Dallas itself a success. "Mr. Stanley," as he was affectionately called by all his Neiman Marcus friends and associates, made The Store a legendary success. Although he retired from active involvement in Neiman Marcus in 1977, the influences of the philosophies of business he developed remained an important part of the training of Neiman Marcus personnel. Those basic principles--best exemplified by his belief in his father's business philosophy--are the reasons Neiman Marcus is today recognized as the taste leader of American retailing. Minding the Store is a warm portrait of a man and an exuberant celebration of the store that has become the best-known landmark in Texas since the Alamo.

As Carmolina's story unfolds, it comes to contain many other narratives: memories and legends from the old country, passed on by her wise and loving grandmother Doria; the courtship tale of her father, an Italian-American policeman with a gentle heart and an artist's soul, and her mother, a lonely Lithuanian-American waitress; and the painful story of Dorina, her beautiful but silent sister.

 id : 235316 ISBN : 0385509596  | name : Mind Your Own Business  |  description : In the bestselling tradition of Max DePree's LEADERSHIP IS AN ART, LEADING FROM THE HEART offers strong, iconoclastic, often contrarian opinions about leadership, including: - Do more for your workers, for your employees are everything. - The secret to successful leadership is communication. - Lead from the bottom up. - The perfect classroom is two people on a log, where no one can tell who is the teacher and who is the student. - Above all, a CEO must inspire others. What makes these opinions so compelling is the success of the man who holds them. Sidney Hannan, the chairman and CEO of Hannan International, the world's premier manufacturer of high-end audio equipment, has also served as the Assistant Secretary under President Carter and the President of Friends World College. His company has flourished while others floundered thanks to his "maverick" style of management, rejecting the notion of CEO as top-down commander and instead, creating a culture of personal integrity and responsibility from the bottom-up. Hannan International's top executives resemble a jazz quartet; a team who listens to and improvises with one another to create harmony. Hannan believes that his employees are everything; he has created schools at his worksites that teach English, basic math, health and music, and encouraged their aspirations in the company. At 84, Sidney Hannan, who works out everyday thinks an "idea a day" is more important than an apple, and believes the key to long life is curiosity. LEADING FROM THE HEART gets to the heart about how to bring strength, vitality, and longevity to your business and your life.

 id : 235319 ISBN : 8401459338  | name : El cambio del poder  |  description : "El cambio del poder es la culminacion de un esfuerzo de veinticinco anos que se propuso dar sentido a los asombrosos cambios con los que vamos a traspasar el umbral del siglo XXI." En la simplicidad de esa frase se esconde la mejor definicion para una obra que marca el final de una completa trilogia. Asi, Alvin Toffler - autor del libro y uno de los "profetas" mas importantes de nuestro tiempo- ofrece, una decada antes del comienzo del nuevo milenio, su vision sobre los grandes acontecimientos que regiran el mundo. Y explica como se pueden aprovechar sus impactos.La obra, al igual que sus predecesoras, El shock del futuro y La tercera Ola, expone un analisis claro de la nueva civilizacion. Para esto propone observar la profunda relacion que existe entre eventos aparentemente inconexos. A lo largo del texto, demuestra que las reestructuraciones corporativas no son mas que las primeras salvas de futuras batallas empresariales. Y sube la apuesta. Toffler describe las tensas relaciones entre los paises de primer nivel por la supervivencia.El libro trata en profundidad las crecientes luchas por el poder que se generan a medida que se diluye el dominio de la civilizacion industrial. Centra el papel del conocimiento en relacion al poder, presenta una nueva teoria de dominio social, y examina los cambios que se avecinan en los negocios, la economia, la politica y los asuntos mundiales. "Las estadisticas cambian, las nuevas tecnologias suplantan a las viejas y los politicos pasan -asegura Toffler-. Sin embargo, es mejor tener un mapa, aunque sea general e incompleto, que no tener mapa alguno."

Zekman and Smith bought The Mirage tavern, then sat back and recorded the parade of city inspectors, liquor vendors, tradesmen, and others with their sticky fingers extended. With evidence in hand, they shut down the bar and wrote a series of articles that have never been matched in intensity and long-term effect. The Mirage became synonymous with Chicago corruption. The journalistic accolades also flowed in, but the Zekman and Smith's bid for the biggest-the Pulitzer Prize-was torpedoed, perhaps by jealous colleagues at another major metropolitan paper.

From this point northward, the California climate is different, the scenery is different, and the people are different.

The Gold Rush of the mid-1800s played a prominent role in stimulating the development of this part of the state, and in many places abandoned mines and ghost towns still polka-dot the hillsides. If the land has acquired a reputation as a travel destination, however, it is because of its majestic beauty OCo the beauty of its woods, lakes, rivers, and its singularly outstanding mountain, Mount Shasta. One of the most remote regions in OC the lower 48 states is the northeasterly corner of California. Still, it is beautiful country, checker-boarded with national and state forests, mountains, lakes, rushing rivers, andababbling streams. Cultural excursions, hiking, beach walking, skiing, canoeing, diving, biking, rafting tours - every activity is detailed here, along with all the information on where to stay, including camping, and where to eat in every part of Northern California."

 id : 235408 ISBN : 0943358019  | name : Wisdom of the Tarot  |  description : This book relates the path to higher consciousness through the colour, shape, and symbolic forms on the twenty-two Tarot cards. Detailed study and meditation of each card may release internally all that is involved with each level encountered on the journey towards the Light. These cards may be used in conjunction with the text or separately for meditation. When studied individually, a card can reveal the necessary steps that need to be taken to actualise one's potential. Tarot cards, or symbolic representations of the truth have always been used to help man relate not only with the mind, but internally, through the feelings invoked by the colours and forms. The nature of these cards is that they can produce a strong awakening of ones unconscious forces. They are like a spiritual mirror in which we can recognise and examine ourselves. We can then understand that the reasons for our fate lie within ourselves, and changes by the mere fact that we begin to react differently to everything that happens to us. These cards with the text are a valuable key to understand our present state, our past and in a deeper sense, how we create our future. Included in the book are 22 pages of five-colour tarot illustrations.

 id : 235452 ISBN : 0517100347  | name : The Best of Louisa May Alcott  |  description : A splendid editionthe first contemporary collection of Louisa May Alcotts novels and stories; one that includes the art of the great nineteenth-century illustrator Frank T. Merrill. Madelon Bedell, author ofThe Alcotts: Biography of a Family Louisa May Alcott was a writer who liked to be in intimate touch with the reader. There is a confidential immediacy to her style, often punctuated with sly stabs of satire and irony. One of the principal charms of her writing is her great warmth for her characters, and theirs for one another. Nowhere is this better displayed than in the classicsLittle WomenandLittle Men, which are here in their entirety. The short stories in THE BEST OF LOUISA MAY ALCOTT come from the period of Alcotts most powerful and mature writing, which began in the 1860s, when she dealt forcibly with real issues and real people. These stories touch on strong human qualitiesjoy, compassion, humor, courage, dignity, heart-tugging poignancy, guilt, or fancifulnessand portray the moments when those qualities come into focus. Alcotts work has a wonderful range. There are delicious romance, like the frankly autobiographical My Boys, a rollicking account of some of the authors experiences, full of her salty, sardonic humor and generosity of spirit. There is also Cupid and Chow-Chow, still very relevant today, dealing with courage and guilt, and sexism in the nursery. There is comedy and suspense in Clams, a marvelous ghost story. There are wonderful animal stories, including Rosas Tale, the heroine of which is a horse, as well as a description of a day at the zoo in My May-Day Among Curious Birds and Beasts. There are also holiday stories here, like An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving, and two Christmas stories: How It All Happened, and Tessas Surprise. And perhaps most moving of all is A Night, fromHospital Sketches, the story of a nurses vigil at the bedside of an extraordinarily brave and dignified soldier wounded in the Civil War. This charming collection, enhanced by beautiful original illustrations, makes clear the timeless appeal of Louisa May Alcotts work.

 id : 235456 ISBN : 0452268834  | name : Lost in Yonkers  |  description : Neil Simons inimitable play about the trials and tribulations that test family tieswinner of the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. What happens to children in the absence of love? That is the question that lies at the heart of this funny and heartrending play by one of Americas most acclaimed and beloved playwrights. Debuting at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in 1990, Lost in Yonkers went on to win four Tony Awards, including Best Play, as well as the Pulitzer Prize, and tells the moving drama about the cruelties and painful memories that scar a family. It is New York, 1942. After the death of their mother, two young brothers are sent to stay with their formidable grandmother for the longest ten months of their lives. Grandmother Kurnitz is a one-woman German fronta refugee and a widow who has steeled her heart against the world. Her coldness and intolerance have crippled her own children: the boys father has no self-esteem; their Aunt Gert has an embarrassing speech impediment; their Uncle Louie is a small-time gangster; and their Aunt Bella has the mentality of a child. But it is Bella's hunger for affection and her refusal to be denied love that saves the boysand that leads to an unforgettable, wrenching confrontation with her mother. Filled with laughter, tears, and insight, Lost in Yonkers is a heartwarming testament to Neil Simons talent.

 id : 235508 ISBN : 0451517725  | name : Antony and Cleopatra  |  description : Edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, Research Professor of English, University of Sussex. Antony and Cleopatra is one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies: a spectacular, widely-ranging drama of love and war, passion and politics. Antony is divided between the responsibilities of imperial power and the intensities of his sexual relationship with Cleopatra. She, variously generous and ruthless, loving and jealous, petulant and majestic, emerges as Shakespeare's most complex depiction of a woman: Age cannot wither her, nor custom staleHer infinite variety. Unsurpassed in sumptous eloquence and powerful characterisation, Anthony and Cleopatra deservedly retains its popularity in the theatre. Its insights into the corruptions of power and the ambiguities of desire remain timely. This volume is part of the Wordsworth Classics' Shakespeare Series, in which each volume has been edited by Cedric Watts. Readers wishing to know more of Cedric Watts work should buy his Shakespeare Puzzles, published by PublishNation (ISBN 978-1-291-66410-2), available from Amazon (both in printed and Kindle editions) and through all good bookshops.
 id : 235510 ISBN : 0140390154  | name : Rights of Man  |  description : One of the great classics on democracy, Rights of Man was published in England in 1791 as a vindication of the French Revolution and a critique of the British system of government. In direct, forceful prose, Paine defends popular rights, national independence, revolutionary war, and economic growthall considered dangerous and even seditious issues. In his introduction Eric Foner presents an overview of Paine's career as political theorist and pamphleteer, and supplies essential background material to Rights of Man. He discusses how Paine created a language of modern politics that brought important issues to the common man and the working classes and assesses the debt owed to Paine by the American and British radical traditions.

 id : 235521 ISBN : 0679409955  | name : Women in Love  |  description : Women in Love, the novel that D. H. Lawrence considered his best, is a powerful portrayal of two couples dynamically engaged in a struggle with themselves, with each other, and with lifes intractable limitations. The sisters Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, whom we first met in Lawrences novel The Rainbow, here become involved with two close friends: Rupert, an intellectual school inspector; and Gerald, the wealthy heir to a mine owner. The turbulent relationships that resultchronicled with an emotional and sexual frankness that provoked controversy on the books publication in 1920take the characters from an English landscape of coal mines and sooty factories to the snowy heights of the Alps, where tragedy strikes. Women in Love was written during World War I, and while that conflict is never mentioned in the novel, a sense of background danger, of lurking catastrophe, continually informs its drama. Lawrence was a powerful, prophetic writer, but in addition he brought such delicacy to his treatment of the human and natural worlds that E. M. Forsters claim that he was the greatest imaginative novelist of his generation does him too little justice rather than too much.

 id : 235565 ISBN : 0679741828  | name : Anne Sexton  |  description : Anne Sexton began writing poetry at the age of twenty-nine to keep from killing herself. She held on to language for dear life and somehow -- in spite of alcoholism and the mental illness that ultimately led her to suicide -- managed to create a body of work that won a Pulitzer Prize and that still sings to thousands of readers. This exemplary biography, which was nominated for the National Book Award, provoked controversy for its revelations of infidelity and incest and its use of tapes from Sexton's psychiatric sessions. It reconciles the many Anne Sextons: the 1950s housewife; the abused child who became an abusive mother; the seductress; the suicide who carried "kill-me pills" in her handbag the way other women carry lipstick; and the poet who transmuted confession into lasting art.

 id : 235576 ISBN : 188836386X  | name : Power, Privilege and the Post  |  description : Katherine Graham's story has all the elements of the phoenix rising from the ashes, and in Carol Felsenthal's unauthorized biography, Power, Privilege, and the Post, Graham's personal tragedies and triumphs are revealed. The homely and insecure daughter of the Jewish millionaire and owner of The Washington Post, Eugene Myer, Kay married the handsome, brilliant and power hungry Phillip Graham in 1940. By 1948 Kay's father had turned control of The Washington Post over to Phil, who spent the next decade amassing a media empire that included radio and TV stations. But, as Felsenthal shows, he mostly focused on building the reputation of the Post and positioning himself as a Washington power-player. Plagued by manic depression, Phil's behavior became more erratic and outlandish, and his downward spiral ended in 1963 when he took his own life. Surprising the newspaper industry, Kay Graham took control of the paper, beginning one of the most unprecedented careers in media history. Felsenthal weaves her exhaustive research into a perceptive portrayal of the Graham family and an expert dissection of the internal politics at the Post, and a portrait of one of a unique, tragic, and ultimately triumphant figure of twentieth-century America.

 id : 235590 ISBN : 0679415211  | name : May Sarton  |  description : The first biography of May Sarton: a brilliant revelation of the life and work of a literary figure who influenced her thousands of readers not only by her novels and poetry, but by her life and her writings about it. May Sarton's career stretched from 1930 (early sonnets published in Poetry magazine) to 1995 (her journal At Eighty-Two). She wrote more than twenty novels, and twenty-five books of poems and journals. The acclaimed biographer Margot Peters was given full access to Sarton's letters, journals, and notes, and during five years of research came to know Sarton herself--the complex woman and artist. She gives us a compelling portrait of Sarton the actress, the poet, the novelist, the feminist, the writer who struggled for literary acceptance. She shows us, beneath Sarton's exhilarating, irresistible spirit, the needy courtier and seducer, the woman whose creativity was propelled by the psychic drama she created in others. We watch young May at age two as she is abruptly uprooted from her native Belgium by World War I, a child ignored both by her mother, who was intent on her own artistic vision and reluctant to cope with a child, and by her father, obsessed with his academic research. We see Sarton as a young girl in America, and then later, at nineteen, choosing a life in the theatre, landing a job in Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory, and gathering what would become a tight-knit coterie of friends and lovers . . . Sarton beginning to write poetry and novels . . . Sarton making friends with Elizabeth Bowen and Julian Huxley, Erika and Klaus Mann, Virginia Woolf, the poet H.D.--charming and enlisting them with her work, her vitality, her hunger for love, drivenby her need to conquer (among her conquests: Bowen, Huxley, and later his wife, Juliette). We see her intense friendships with literary pals, including Muriel Rukeyser (her lover), and Louise Bogan, Sarton's "literary sibling, who at once encouraged her and excluded her from a world in which Bogan was a central figure. We see Sarton begin to create in the spiritual journals that inspired the devotion of readers the image of a strong, independent woman who lived peacefully with solitude--an image that contradicted the reality of her neediness, loneliness, and isolation as she pushed away loved ones with her demands and betrayals. A fascinating portrait of one of our major literary figures--a book that for the first time reveals the life that she herself kept hidden.

 id : 235593 ISBN : 0385479832  | name : One More River to Cross  |  description : In the aftermath of the historic 1993 March on Washington for gay and lesbian rights, Keith Boykin, in One More River to Cross, clarifies the relationship between blacks and gays in America by portraying the "common ground" lives of those who are both black and gay. Against a backdrop of civil rights and the black experience in America, Boykin interviews Baptist ministers, gay political leaders, and other black gays and lesbians on issues of faith, family, discrimination, and visibility to determine what differences--real and imagined--separate the two communities. Boykin points to evidence of African and precolonial same-sex behavior, as well as figures like James Baldwin and Bayard Rustin, to dispel the myth that homosexuality is a "white thang," while his research suggests that blacks are less homophobic than whites, despite the rhetoric of rap and religion. With stories from his own experience as well as that of other black gays and lesbians, Boykin targets gay racism and black homophobia and suggests that conservative forces have substituted the common language of racism for homophobia in order to prevent a potentially powerful coalition of blacks and gays. By portraying what it means to be black and gay, One More River to Cross offers an extraordinary window into a community that challenges this country's acceptance of its minorities, both racial and sexual.

Although this was known to many people, I have not been taken before any court of law, or called to account for this in any professional or public forum. In fact, just the opposite occurred: I was rewarded for this. It brought me an improved reputation in my job, & contributed to my advancement afterwards. Not only did I demonstrate I could indeed do what was expected of me, I exemplified the 'good' company doctor: I saved a half-million dollars!"--Linda Peeno, M.D., Testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Commerce, May 30, 1996. SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER REST IN PEACE takes a critical look at America's growing managed-care industry, & offers patient-driven alternatives. Behind HMOs' glossy newsletters & expensive advertising campaigns lie a perverse, unethical & immoral system--one that pits patient against profits.

 id : 235719 ISBN : 038542339X  | name : The Art of the Personal Essay  |  description : For more than four hundred years, the personal essay has been one of the richest and most vibrant of all literary forms. Distinguished from the detached formal essay by its friendly, conversational tone, its loose structure, and its drive toward candor and self-disclosure, the personal essay seizes on the minutiae of daily life-vanities, fashions, foibles, oddballs, seasonal rituals, love and disappointment, the pleasures of solitude, reading, taking a walk -- to offer insight into the human condition and the great social and political issues of the day. The Art of the Personal Essay is the first anthology to celebrate this fertile genre. By presenting more than seventy-five personal essays, including influential forerunners from ancient Greece, Rome, and the Far East, masterpieces from the dawn of the personal essay in the sixteenth century, and a wealth of the finest personal essays from the last four centuries, editor Phillip Lopate, himself an acclaimed essayist, displays the tradition of the personal essay in all its historical grandeur, depth, and diversity.

 id : 235736 ISBN : 0684801531  | name : A Life in Letters  |  description : A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life. In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary "jazz age" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.

 id : 235753 ISBN : 037540807X  | name : Safekeeping  |  description : A stunning new way to celebrate the small moments that make up a life. In flashes of vivid prose -- sometimes in pieces only one page long -- Abigail Thomas breaks up the notion of what is "memoir" to tell us some true stories from her life: about love and upheaval, mistakes and loyalties, adventures and domesticities; marriage and motherhood at a very young age; a second husband who becomes both an ex and a dear friend in need; a smart-mouthed sister who helps her get through hard times; the many shades of feminine power and female rage; the changing face of desire. Safekeeping is a book in which white space speaks as eloquently as what is revealed. Openhearted and effortlessly funny, these brilliantly selected glimpses of the arc of a life are, in the age of too much confession, a welcome breath of fresh air.
 id : 235755 ISBN : 0878052925  | name : The Correspondence of Flannery O'Connor and the Brainard Cheneys  |  description : In 1953 Flannery O'Connor was so pleased by Brainard Cheney's review of her much misunderstood first novel Wise Blood that she wrote the reviewer to thank him. What Cheney, himself a novelist, had said about the book was right on target. Very soon a friendship between this rising star of southern literature and Brainard and Frances Cheney was flourishing. Over the next eleven years there was a spirited exchange of letters and visits. Whenever possible, the Cheneys stopped by Andalusia, the O'Connor farm near Milledgeville, Georgia, and O'Connor was able to visit them at Cold Chimneys, their home in Smyrna, Tennessee. This fascinating book collecting their correspondence reveals a devoted friendship that ended with Flannery O'Connor's death at thirty-nine in 1964. In these 188 letters, all previously unpublished, we see a new aspect of her life, the part she shared with "Lon" and "Fannie" Cheney. These letters not only give the pleasure of knowing more about the talented Cheneys, an eminent couple close to the Tate circle, but also provide yet another occasion for readers to revel in the delight of Flannery O' Connor's sparkling wit and dark humor. From O'Connor there are 117 letters, from Cheney 71. All Mrs. Cheney's letters to Flannery have been lost, but from the surviving correspondence the reader can note with pleasure the interests that seemed to draw this trio closer as they shared opinions and reports about their native South, their Roman Catholicism, their novels in progress, and their commitment to good writing. But it is chiefly the literary illuminations via these letters that enhance the friendship as well as ignite the reader's compelling curiosity. The letters focus attention upon a time in Flannery O'Connor's life when correspondence was of great importance to her. The O'Connor/Cheney letters make it clear that her circumscribed life was enlarged and enriched by this friendship during her most creative and productive years. - Jacket flap.

The Last Empire" is Gore Vidal's ninth collection of essays in the course of his distinguished literary career. As in the previous volumes, which include the 1993 National Book Award-winning "United States: Essays 1952-1992, Vidal displays unparalleled range and inimitable style as he deals with matters literary, historical, personal, and political. There are warm (and shrewd) appreciations of Edmund Wilson, Dawn Powell, Sinclair Lewis, and Mark Twain; polemical observations on the major figures and (as he sees it) deplorable developments in American politics, Bill Clinton, FDR, JFK, his cousin Al Gore, the CIA and the American empire, the global reach of media conglomerates, and the United States' disdain for the UN, as well as fascinating autobiographical vignettes. Pieces that have already generated shock waves include his essay in dispraise of the works of John Updike, his controversial defense of Charles Lindbergh, and his attack on the national security state that first appeared in "Vanity Fair. Nobody makes the fur fly in a more elegant and civilized fashion than Gore Vidal. He is our indispensable man.

It was based on a famous story of a court case in mid-16th century France.Janet Lewis depicts a distant time and a traditional, rural culture based on a highly ordered patriarchal structure. When "Martin Guerre" returns from a quest after eight years, the family embraces him, and Bertrande is swept up in the relief at the apparent return to the security of the old order.But Martin has changed, and Bertrande threatens the established order with her defiant quest for the truth. Once the accusation of false identity is laid formally and the trial process begins. Many witnesses are called. Bertrande is pressured to withdraw, and she herself is reluctant to see "Martin" executed.Finally, the real, battle-weary Martin stumbles into the courtroom and is instantly recognized. He shows no mercy to Bertrande for allowing herself to be deceived. The real facts emerge, but the fate of Bertrande and Martin remains open-ended. In this new edition of Janet Lewiss classic short novel, The Wife of Martin Guerre, Swallow Press executive editor Kevin Haworth writes that Lewiss story is a short novel of astonishing depth and resonance, a sharply drawn historical tale that asks contemporary questions about identity and belonging, about men and women, and about an individuals capacity to act within an inflexible system. Originally published in 1941, The Wife of Martin Guerre has earned the respect and admiration of critics and readers for over sixty years. Based on a notorious trial in sixteenth-century France, this story of Bertrande de Rols is the first of three novels making up Lewiss Cases of Circumstantial Evidence suite (the other two are The Trial of Sören Qvist and The Ghost of Monsieur Scarron).

 id : 235943 ISBN : 0060192372  | name : The Heart Revolution  |  description : Eat your way to a healthier heart! Heart disease is the number one killer in America, and the widespread belief is that it is caused by a diet high in fat and cholesterol. Why do many heart attack victims have "normal" cholesterol levels? Why do the French, who love foie gras and red wine, rarely develop heart disease? How is it that the native people of Greenland and the Masai of Africa, whose diets consists largely of animal fat, have almost no heart disease? For eighty-five years, the cholesterol theory of heart disease reigned supreme. But it has never been scientifically proven that fats and cholesterol cause arteriosclerosis or that lowering the amount of fat and cholesterol in our diets will reduce our risk of developing heart disease. In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Kilmer McCully explains what is really behind the epidemic of heart disease. The Harvard-trained physician and researcher reveals how the vitamin B deficiency in our Western diet has produced harmful blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid produced in the body. Homocysteine damages the arteries, leaving them susceptible to cholesterol and fat deposits. For many years clogged arteries have been inaccurately viewed as the cause, rather than the symptom, of heart disease. Now McCully shows you how to cut your risk of heart disease by controlling the real culprit, homocysteine. Considered one of the most significant medical breakthroughs in recent years, McCully's findings have been validated by numerous large-scale studies. The Heart Revolution: challenged the long-held assumptions that lowering cholesterol is the key to preventing heart disease explains how eating vitamin B-rich food can control homocysteine levels lays pout a plan with menus for putting more B vitamins in our diet discusses how food processing and additives compromise our health exposes the politics within the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry explains how costly cholesterol-lowering medicines can actually harm our health In the 1970s, pharmaceutical houses were making huge profits on cholesterol-lowering drugs. When McCully dared to challenge the prevailing view that cholesterol caused heart disease, he was castigated by his peers. Thirty years later he has received international recognition for the very same work. The Heart Revolution is more than a revolutionary program for disease prevention, it is also an intriguing tale of medical discovery.

 id : 236075 ISBN : 0268002843  | name : Towards a Better Understanding of History  |  description : "History," writes Bernard Norling, "is not a series of unconnected episodes, all about equally important or equally useless, each embellished with a chapter title, and all then assembled in a book. It is a seamless garment, each part of which is related to all the others. It should be studied as such: studied with the object of understanding how civilizations change and why; how societies differ in many ways yet usually have to face the same kinds of problems; how innumerable ideas, events, and institutions from the past have made our present world what it is." In this eminently practical book, Professor Norling provides the beginning student of history with a basic orientation towards the subject. He explains why the study of history is worthwhile, discusses the fundamental concepts and methods involved, and shows the student how to start doing historical research. Yet the book is not an abstract treatise, for Professor Norling constantly illustrates what he has to say about history with fascinating and pertinent examples from history. In so doing he truly shows how the events of the past make up that "seamless web" that in time includes us all.

 id : 236106 ISBN : 0879053356  | name : La Bohème  |  description : "Set in the Latin Quarter of 1840s Paris, Henri Murger's La Boheme creates a stark and colorful record of the boisterous, lean, and sensual world of eternal Bohemia. The author, like his character Rudolph, was a dispossessed poet living from hand to mouth while serving his literary apprenticeship in the hustle-and-bustle streets of the artists' quarter. In order to make a little money, Murger created fictional episodes based on his experiences in the heart of Bohemia and sold the first of them in 1847 - for fifteen francs each - to a small literary magazine titled Le Corsaire. From this humble beginning, La Boheme has become an undying tribute to true Bohemians or, as Murger describes them, "those called by art." The episodes first published in Le Corsaire were gathered into a book that sold 70,000 copies. Then in 1849 Theodore Barriere made the story into a play, which became a popular sensation in Paris. And finally Giacomo Puccini transformed Murger's tale into the famous opera, a work that continues to be applauded by audiences throughout the world. La Boheme, is a one-of-a-kind journey to a raw yet romantic place, to a sphere where people hunger for both artistic ideals and morsels of food."--Back cover.

The careful reader will discover such incidental insights as his theory of why Eskimos gave up kissing for rubbing noses and what the young Marquis de Sade's nanny said that may have suggested all those weird ideas. But the casual reader will learn something too. And not just that the author has entirely too much time on his hands. Interspersed among these views of the passing scene are subtle indications that--paddles or not--we may all of us be headed up the creek. So to speak.

 id : 236175 ISBN : 0029283752  | name : The Inarticulate Society  |  description : In The Inarticulate Society, Thomas Shachtman persuasively argues that Americans have lost the ability to respond to other points of view - to argue - without coming swiftly to blows. His case is forcefully punctuated by the rising tide of political violence in America and the hateful and intolerant speech that appears to incite it. We are in danger of moving our political debates from the Senate chamber to the streets, in the process of losing the social stability needed for a working democracy. Shachtman pins the blame for this decline on the jargon-spouting "specialists" in the professions and academia, who use parochial vocabulary to erect linguistic barriers between themselves and "ordinary" citizens; on teachers who are barely articulate themselves; on the pervasiveness of popular entertainment geared to the lowest common denominator; on insipid advertising and marketing campaigns that deliberately bypass reason to appeal to emotions; and especially on our political leaders who find it easier to play the demagogue than to give substantive explanations of policy choices. Shachtman proposes a concrete, multifaceted program for rehabilitating eloquence through the constructive use of media together with political and educational reform.

 id : 236179 ISBN : 0684842343  | name : Luxury Fever  |  description : Why, against all good reason, do we continue to accelerate our spending to the limits of our bank accounts? As the Western nations struggle, with personal bankruptcy at an all time high, the chase after the 'biggest and latest' continues to escalate. In this thought-provoking analysis of the economics of personal decisions, Robert Frank chronicles the new boom of conspicuous consumption and exposes the hidden prices we pay for ever more elaborate houses, cars and lifestyles. In LUXURY FEVER, Frank argues that our current profligacy is not because we are foolish, undisciplined, greedy, or manipulated. Rather, how we feel about our material goods is entirely dependant on everyone else's spending. By acting together, we can choose to invest more in the sleep, exercise, family time, and less conspicuous consumption that makes life worthwhile.

 id : 236190 ISBN : 0906224098  | name : The Revolutionary Ideas of Karl Marx  |  description : Few thinkers have been declared irrelevant and out of date with such frequency as Karl Marx. Hardly a decade since his death has gone by in which establishment critics have not announced the death of his theory. Whole forests have been felled to produce the paper necessary to fuel this effort to marginalize the coauthor of The Communist Manifesto. And yet, despite their best efforts to bury him again and again, Marx's specter continues to haunt his detractors more than a century after his passing. As another international economic collapse pushes ever growing numbers out of work, and a renewed wave of popular revolt sweeps across the globe, a new generation is learning to ignore all the taboos and scorn piled upon Marx's ideas and rediscovering that the problems he addressed in his time are remarkably similar to those of our own. In this engaging and accessible introduction, Alex Callinicos demonstrates that Marx's ideas hold an enduring relevance for today's activists fighting against poverty, inequality, oppression, environmental destruction, and the numerous other injustices of the capitalist system.

Relying on new research and improved translations, Davis uncovers some amazing questions and contradictions about what the Bible really says. Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. Moses never parted the Red Sea. There was a Jesus, but he wasn't born on Christmas and he probably wasn't an only child. Davis brings readers up-to-date on findings gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels that prompt serious scholars to ask such serious questions as: Who wrote the Bible? Did Jesus say everything we were taught he did? Did he say more? By examining the Bible historically, Davis entertains and amazes, provides a much better understanding of the subject, and offers much more fun learning about it.

 id : 236305 ISBN : 0345405331  | name : The Life of Elizabeth I  |  description : Perhaps the most influential sovereign England has ever known, Queen Elizabeth I reigned prosperously for more than forty years, from 1558 until her death in 1603. During her rule, however, she remained an extremely private person, keeping her own counsel and sharing secrets with no one--not even her closest, most trusted advisors. Now, in this brilliantly researched, fascinating new book, acclaimed biographer Alison Weir brings the enigmatic figure of Elizabeth 1 to life as never before. Here are provocative new interpretations and fresh insights on the intimacy between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, who rose from Master of the Horse to become Earl of Leicester; the imprisonment and execution of Elizabeth's rival, Mary Stuart; Elizabeth's clash with Philip of Spain, once her suitor and then her enemy; and the cruel betrayal of her beloved Essex. Against a lavish backdrop of pageantry and passion, intrigue and war, Weir dispels the myths surrounding Elizabeth I and examines the contradictions of her character, exploring complex questions. Elizabeth I loved the Earl of Leicester, but did she conspire to murder his wife? She called herself the Virgin Queen, but how chaste was she through dozens of liaisons? She never married, but was her choice to remain single tied to the chilling fate of her mother, Anne Boleyn? An enthralling epic that is also an amazingly intimate portrait, Alison Weir's The Life of Elizabeth I is a work of deep reflection and extraordinary scholarship--a mesmerizing, stunning reading experience.

 id : 236354 ISBN : 0874778093  | name : Finding What You Didn't Lose  |  description : Poetry discovers and speaks a truth ordinary language cannot express. And the passionate message in Finding What You Didn't Lose is that we're all poets--capable of giving voice to such truth. Poet-teacher John Fox reveals how imagery, sound, metaphor, rhythm, and other poetic elements can he us tell our inner story, heal psychological wounds, discover spiritual connection, and develop the rich creative imagination that lies within us all. Transcending the traditional academic approach to poetry writing, Finding What You Didn't Lose deals with craft but, more importantly, guides readers to explore their deepest feelings and express their own unique insights through the incomparable language of poetry. Through an intermingling of inventive exercises and illustrative poems--ranging from Nobel Prize winners to first-time poets--readers are inspired to add their own distinct voice to a world fellowship of poets. For those who already write poetry, and the many more who want to, this book is the key to finding what you never lose: your natural inclination to express who you are through the making of poems.
 id : 236355 ISBN : 0192826646  | name : The Karamazov Brothers  |  description : Dostoevsky's last and greatest novel, The Karamazov Brothers (1880) is both a brilliantly told crime story and a passionate philosophical debate.

Filled with eloquent voices, this new translation fully realizes the power and dramatic virtuosity of Dostoevsky's most brilliant work.

 id : 236375 ISBN : 0060563524  | name : My French Kitchen  |  description : It's not surprising that Joanne Harris's novels -- Chocolat, Blackberry Wine, and Five Quarters of the Orange -- celebrate the pleasure and magic of food, since her fondest childhood memories are of making pancakes with her great-grandmother Mémée, picking blackberries with her grandfather in Yorkshire, and exploring the early morning markets of Noirmoutier. Now, with coauthor Fran Warde, Harris shares her treasured collection of family recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation in this illustrated cookbook. Harris encourages cooks to engage all their senses when cooking -- look at what you're cooking, smell the ingredients, mix them with your fingers, and enjoy their sounds and textures. Cooking, she reminds us, is about as close to magic as modern society allows: to take a handful of simple, fresh ingredients and turn them into something wonderful, otherworldly. The 120 recipes include French classics such as Onion Soup and Onion Tart, Coq au Vin, and Crème Brûlée, as well as family favorites like Anouchka's Chile Garlic Bread, great-aunt Simone's Marinated Tuna, and great-aunt Marinette's Slow Fudge Sauce. And, of course, there's an entire chapter devoted to chocolate -- cakes, meringues, and spiced hot chocolate. My French Kitchen, a remarkable collaboration between Joanne Harris, a writer who loves food, and Fran Warde, a former chef who loves to write about food, belongs in your kitchen.

Price, ageless village elder, assisted by Watkins's parents, his own worthy spouse, his cousin's beautiful and fertile wife, Dr. Daniel Morgan, that disgrace to Medicine, and the massed choristers of Glantawe, where all truths are possible and most are at least attempted. Yet Watkins, too, is part of what he suffers: fated to delude, invent, re-live his delirium and folly, accept as gospel the story of the hour.

 id : 236412 ISBN : 0864923686  | name : Way Up  |  description : In the thirteen stories that comprise Way Up, Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer's canvas stretches from downtown Toronto to isolated farms, from the Canadian Shield to Nova Scotia and Europe, and even into outer space. In "The Last Magic Forest," she turns her Gothic imagination loose in the bush of Northern Ontario, where tree planters have developed a unique culture. In this wasteland of clear-cutting and scarifying, the concept of "nature" overturns everything readers (and tree planters) expect. When Kuitenbrouwer takes a Canadian tree planter to Belgium in "What Had Become of Us," only the outer topography changes. In the superficially more cultivated European forest, the value and meaning of human life depends on the inner topography the forester brings with her from the Ontario bush. In other stories, Kuitenbrouwer's characters engage in a continual play with perspective, in a perpetual balancing act. In an emotional spectrum ranging from corrosive grief to murderous recklessness, Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer's characters make  or fail to make  the constant adjustments necessary to stay fully human. By intention or accident, each character steps into a more comprehensible life or crosses into seductive darkness.

Using everyday examples from popular culturefilms, Star Trek, soap operas, comic stripsit describes the sixteen basic ways people come to terms with their gifts and values. In this book you will find tools to understand:  How your personality takes shape  How your type reflects not only your current priorities, but your hidden potential  How unlived possibilities are trying to get your attention  How relationships at home and at work can help you to tap your unrealized gifts

 id : 236478 ISBN : 0451516850  | name : Oliver Twist  |  description : The gaunt, pathetic figure of orphan Oliver being refused more gruel has become a literary and cultural icon, embedded in the national consciousness as a searing image of poverty and helplessness, dramatizing as it does the extent to which what is taken for granted at home is denied in the workhouse. Yet the novel, a powerful indictment of the workhouse, is also more than that, for even as Oliver escapes its callous grasp, he is snared by the criminal underworld of Fagin's gang. Oliver's struggle to be free of Fagin and Sikes, and his desperate search for a loving, nurturing home, express the theme that forms the real crux of the book; the poignant depiction of the evils of homelessness and its consequences. Full of vivid characterizations, biting irony and ghoulish humor, Oliver Twist is one of Dickens most enduringly popular works. The Toby Press edition of Oliver Twist is based on the Gadshill Edition of 1897, and includes Dickens's preface to the third edition. It also features an introductory essay and chronology by Professor H.M. Daleski, the former President of the International Dickens Society and formerly Chairman of the Department of English at Hebrew University. Book jacket.

 id : 236538 ISBN : 1887178058  | name : Jesuits  |  description : In this magisterial account, Jean Lacouture portrays the sweep of five hundred years of world history, from the dungeons of the Vatican to the jungles of South America to the royal courts of Europe and Asia. Jesuits: A Multibiography is history with a human face, the fascinating tales of men of the spirit who participated in the actions and passions of the modern world, a "world bursting its seams". "Be all things to all men", said the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola, to his followers. "Go and set the world ablaze!" The often picaresque story takes us to the Paris of Rabelais, where Ignatius, with a handful of his fellow students, formed what would become the Society of Jesus. We follow Francis Xavier to Japan and Matteo Ricci to China. We watch as the Society grows into Christendom's most powerful order, and as the "Black Legend" of a calculating, Machiavellian Jesuitry leads to its abolition in 1773 (it was restored forty years later). We see the great characters of history and culture - Pascal, Voltaire, Frederick the Great, Catherine the Great - play their parts. One of Jean Lacouture's most poignant portraits is of the twentieth century's most famous and beloved Jesuit, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a scientist-priest whose humanistic conclusions put him at odds with the Church. Lacouture's wide-ranging narrative illuminates Pope John XXIII's reforms and the Jesuit-inspired liberation theology movements in Central and South America. With the papacy of John Paul II, a riveting drama unfolds as the Jesuits are brought under new constraints.
 id : 236539 ISBN : 0671028103  | name : How I Got to Be This Hip  |  description : The finest pieces by Barry Farrell, one of America's preeminent journalists, are drawn together for the first time in this wise, funny, and moving collection. From first-person musings to scathing social commentary, Farrell chronicled the country's changing cultural tides from the 1960s through the '80s -- and articulated his views with unparalleled precision and insight.His peers (among them, Joan Didion, John Gregory Dunne, John McPhee, Calvin Trillin, and Norman Mailer) still regard him as one of the most talented nonfiction writers of his time. And what a time: Woodstock, the Manson murders, Allen Ginsberg's tender raging, Patty Hearst's kidnapping and trial, Gary Gilmore's execution/suicide, the LAPD's laughable botching of the Hillside Strangler case. Farrell somehow found his way to the center of all these media events, quickly separated the heroes from the charlatans, and went home to out-write every reporter on the scene.A must-read for students of writing and followers of journalism,How I Got To Be This Hipis a timeless mirror of America, as seen through the eyes of one of its most astute observers.

Hoegrefe's encounter with the ninety-three-year-old artist and with Juan Hamilton, the young man she loved in her final years, evolved into an ongoing series of interviews with Hamilton that gave Hogrefe exceptional access to O'Keeffe's friends and colleagues and provided him with unique insights into her private world, as well as into Hamilton's own controversial relationship with O'Keeffe during the last fourteen years of her life. Her acerbic personality, her unconventional lifestyle, and her struggles as an artist and a woman are brought to life in this definitive biography of Georgia O'Keeffe.

 id : 236612 ISBN : 087975446X  | name : Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844  |  description : Communism as a political movement attained global importance after the Bolsheviks toppled the Russian Czar in 1917. After that time the works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, especially the influential Communist Manifesto (1848), enjoyed an international audience. The world was to learn a new political vocabulary peppered with "socialism," "capitalism," "the working class," "the bourgeoisie," "labor theory of value," "alienation," "economic determinism," "dialectical materialism," and "historical materialism." Marx's economic analysis of history has been a powerful legacy, the effects of which continue to be felt world-wide. Serving as the foundation for Marx's indictment of capitalism is his extraordinary work titled Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, written in 1844 but published nearly a century later. Here Marx offers his theory of human nature and an analysis of emerging capitalism's degenerative impact on man's sense of self and his creative potential. What is man's true nature? How did capitalism gain such a foothold on Western society? What is alienation and how does it threaten to undermine the proletariat? These and other vital questions are addressed as the youthful Marx sets forth his first detailed assessment of the human condition.

Roth gleefully exploits our readiness to let baseball stand for America itself" (The New York Times). Gil Gamesh, the only pitcher who ever literally tried to kill the umpire. The ex-con first baseman, John Baal, "The Babe Ruth of the Big House," who never hit a home run sober. If you've never heard of themor of the homeless baseball team the Ruppert Mundysit's because of the Communist plot, and the capitalist scandal, that expunged the entire Patriot League from baseball memory. In this ribald, wickedly satiric novel, Roth turns baseball's status as national pastime and myth into an occasion for unfettered picaresque farce, replete with heroism and perfidy, ebullient wordplay and a cast of characters that includes the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Dans cet illustre chef-d'oeuvre, l'esprit de dérision prend le contre-pied de la tradition. Une série de sketches désopilants jusqu'au dénouement tonitruant et digne des surréalistes, telle est la pièce dont nous étudions les secrets en la replaçant dans la tradition de l'antitradition, de la modernité en évolution.

Different understandings, values, interests, and contexts lead to varying preferences regarding goals and objectives, alternative interpretations of information and evidence, and variousideas regarding appropriate strategies and actions. Indeed, resource and environmental management often seem to centre upon the resolution of conflict generated by differing regional, sectoral, substantive, or ideological perspectives. Uncertainty is also a basic feature of resource andenvironmental management. Nevertheless, decisions must be made, even when analysts and managers are not at all sure about future or present conditions. The twin focus on conflict and uncertainty is a reminder that there are rarely perfect solutions to complex problems, but rather a mix ofimperfect responses from which we must choose.In this second edition, all twelve chapters in the first edition have been revised, some quite significantly. Also, there are five new chapters that deal with First Nations, gender relationships, free trade, fisheries management on the East Coast, and tensions between hinterland and heartlandareas.

 id : 236691 ISBN : 0198506740  | name : Pandora's Picnic Basket  |  description : The first book to look at all the issues involved in GM (genetically modified food) technology in a clear and dispassionate way. Alan McHughen surveys the technology that makes GM food possible, assesses the risk of health and environmental dangers and the regulatory and labelling processes in force to protect the consumer. Question and answer boxes and case histories, and the author's easy writing style make this an essential purchase for all those interested in the debate. - ;Are you concerned about fish genes in tomatoes? Worried that brazil nut genes in soybeans can result in potentially lethal allergic reactions? That rapeseed plants bred to be resistant to herbicides could become uncontrollable superweeds? You are not alone. The issue of genetically modified foods has fast become one of the most debated of recent years, with scientists and companies seeking to develop the technology on one side, and consumer groups and environmentalists on the other. However, in spite of the great heat generated by the debate, there is very little real information on the subject, either about the technologies in use or about the regulatory processes established to approve the processes and the products. This book sets out to explain, in clear and direct language, the technologies underlying so-called genetically modified food, and compares them with other "natural" methods of plant breeding and production. The author then looks at the safeguards in place from regulators around the world and asks whether these are sufficient. The question of labelling, held by some to be an obvious way out for concerned consumers, is examined, and the honesty and usefulness of some of these labels addressed. The book then looks at issues of real concern, particularly environmental issues, and ways in which a consumer can seek to avoid GMOs if they so choose. In each chapter, key topics are addressed through question and answer boxes. Real case histories illustrate the development and regulation of GMOs, and by the end of the book the reader will be able to make an informed choice about whether to support or challenge this technology, the products of which are increasingly pervasive. -

Through it all, they kept the nation fed on ingeniously nutritious and economical meals - hundreds of the best, and some of the worst, are included here. Moving and fascinating, this is both an illustrated social history and a cookery book offering a remarkable picture of the deprivation and drama of the women's war.
 id : 236695 ISBN : 0688052916  | name : Staying Married...and Loving It!  |  description : Marriage is not an end--it's a beginning. Yet, despite commitment, care, and communication, a marriage will sometimes falter. When it does, the good news is that it can be made wonderful again. Following her landmark Getting to "I Do", Patricia Allen, the "Love Doctor" to over five thousand happily married couples, shares her proven methods for making a marriage come alive with love, passion, intimacy, and openness. Dr. Allen's methods are so simple and basic as to be revolutionary. In each of us there is masculine energy, which leads, provides, and cherishes; and feminine energy, which follows, respects, and responds, sexually and lovingly. In a modern marriage, where freedom of choice can be perplexing, these energies must blend and flow together. They must complement each other; they must not compete. Once we acknowledge our individual energies and learn to communicate appropriately the ground is set for a truly satisfying marriage--physically, mentally, and emotionally.

 id : 236906 ISBN : 0890813736  | name : God's Design for Christian Dating  |  description : A renowned activist recalls his childhood years in an Indian boarding school Best known as a leader of the Indian takeover of Alcatraz Island in 1969, Adam Fortunate Eagle now offers an unforgettable memoir of his years as a young student at Pipestone Indian Boarding School in Minnesota. In this rare firsthand account, Fortunate Eagle lives up to his reputation as a contrary warrior by disproving the popular view of Indian boarding schools as bleak and prisonlike. Fortunate Eagle attended Pipestone between 1935 and 1945, just as Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Colliers pluralist vision was reshaping the federal boarding school system to promote greater respect for Native cultures and traditions. But this book is hardly a dry history of the late boarding school era. Telling this story in the voice of his younger self, the author takes us on a delightful journey into his childhood and the inner world of the boarding school. Along the way, he shares anecdotes of dormitory culture, student pranks, and warrior games. Although Fortunate Eagle recognizes Pipestones shortcomings, he describes his time there as nothing less than a little bit of heaven. Were all Indian boarding schools the dispiriting places that history has suggested? This book allows readers to decide for themselves.

The knot-meter ticks ten, eleven, twelve knots as she surfs downhill, surrounded by streaks of spindrift and flanked by long, breaking crests....We'll keep three on watch at all times tonight, I decide, and we'll rotate a radar operator and a person on the bow every half hour, adding an extra lookout forward if we get into heavy ice conditions. We'll run at speed directly for Saglek Bay -- a fiord in the Tourgat Mountains with a decent anchorage near its mouth that is protected from the north. And we'll cross our fingers, rub every lucky stone, and kiss every four-leaf clover we can find -- hoping we make it safely through.By any account, the impenetrable barrier of sea ice that blocked the Brendan's Isle halfway up the Labrador Coast should not have been there in July, in what was one of the hottest summers on record only a hundred miles to the south.

 id : 236996 ISBN : 034542347X  | name : The Path of the Mother  |  description : "What are the greatest qualities of a Mother? Love, forgiveness, and patience." Much has been written about the feminine faces of God. Now The Path of the Mother introduces us to a divinity more whole than any we have yet encountered--her arms open to men and women of any persuasion or practice. She is at once masculine and feminine, creator and transformer, joy and anguish, the all-loving Mother and the true, realized human Self. Drawing on her most vibrant expression, this inspiring book traces her myriad faces--compassionate, fierce, enchanting, challenging, passionate--in male and female deities of many religions. "As far as Mother is concerned, everyone is her child. . . . Children, did not Mother come when you called? Thus did she not obey you?" The Path of the Mother is a six-stage journey to union with the Great Mother, framed by Savitri Bess's own years of devotion to one of her most famous incarnations--the Hindu mystic Ammachi. Interweaving Hindu myths with her own quest and those of others, Bess reveals this journey as an exodus from aloneness to the wondrous integration of love, worship, and service into life's daily tasks. Practical exercises, meditations, yoga, and prayers will help both novice and veteran seekers to rediscover their innocence, balance their inner masculine and feminine energies, resolve their buried wounds, desires, and talents, and open their hearts to the nurturing guidance of the Mother-God within us all. "Love is Amma's nature. She cannot be otherwise. . . . Amma cannot return our anger, hatred, or abuse. Amma can only bestow boundless compassion and love."

 id : 237000 ISBN : 0300051743  | name : The Healer's Power  |  description : "Although the physician's use and misuse of power have been discussed in the social sciences and in literature, they have never been explored in medical ethics until now. In this book, Dr. Howard Brody argues that the central task is not to reduce the physician's power, as others have suggested, but to develop guidelines for its use, so that the doctor shares with the patient both information and the responsibility for deciding on appropriate treatment." "Dr. Brody first reviews literary works dealing with medical power, from Dostoevsky's "The Grand Inquisitor" to stories by William Carlos Williams, Vonda McIntyre, and Richard Selzer. These works, he shows, reveal the healers' ambivalence over their own power and patients' fears of the abuse of power. Dr. Brody then points out important but neglected ethical issues that emerge from an analysis of power, such as the tension between care of individual patients and the pressures of the doctor's workload; the rescue fantasy that impels some physicians to extraordinary lengths to save a life; and the economic system, which rewards surgeons and other specialists more than it does physicians who spend time talking with patients about their problems. He also shows how the perspective of shared power can shed new light on standard topics in medical ethics--from informed consent and confidentiality to resource allocation and cost containment."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

There Bianca finds herself in the home of seven dwarvesthe creators of the magic mirrorwho await the return of their brother, the eighth dwarf, long gone on a quest of his own. In the evocative style of Maguire's earlier novels, Mirror Mirror is a fresh, compelling take on a beloved classic tale.

 id : 237181 ISBN : 1931498016  | name : Slow Food  |  description : Remember the days before the dot.com explosion, before Golden Arches rose from the Great Plains, before the Age of Information, when the only commodity that wasn't in short supply in America was time? Time to relax and reflect, time to cook well, eat well, and live the life of sustainable hedonism. Today we pound down our Big Mac and fries as we check our e-mail on our collective Palm Pilots, at the expense of true nourishment for our bodies and souls. "Enough!" says Carlo Petrini, the founder ofSlow Food International, a movement that encourages us to turn down the volume, unplug the answering machine, and enjoy life to its fullest. Away with nutraceutical soft drinks and breakfast cereals made from refined sugar and shaped liked clowns. Bring back the pleasure of the palate, and return the humanity to food. More than 60,000 members worldwide now belong to the Slow Food movement, which believes that the slow shall inherit the earth. Slow Food: Collected Thoughts on Taste, Tradition, and the Honest Pleasures of Food is an anthology for cooks, gourmets, and anyone who is passionate about food and its impact on our culture. Drawn from five years of the quarterly journalSlow (only recently available in America), this book includes more than 100 articles covering eclectic topics from "Falafel" to "Fat City." From the market at Ulan Bator in Mongolia to Slow Food Down Under, this book offers an armchair tour of the exotic and bizarre. You'll pass through Vietnam's Snake Tavern, enjoy the Post-Industrial Pint of Beer, and learn why the lascivious villain in Indian cinema always eats Tandoori Chicken. The articles are contributed by some of the world's top food writers. Slow Food is moving fast in North America, with more than 5,000 members, loosely organized into 55 "Convivia," from Montreal to San Francisco, benefiting from enormous free publicity. Slow Food offers a clear alternative to the "fast food nation" (the title of Eric Schlosser's great book on the horrors of the fast food biz). This is a perfect follow-up to Joan Dye Gussow'sThis Organic Life, and is proof positive that he or she who lives slow, lives best.

This fascinating book reconstructs the painting's journey and becomes a rich story of modernist art and the forces behind the art market. Masterfully evoked are the lives of the thirteen extraordinary people who owned the painting and shaped its history: avant-garde European collectors, pioneering dealers in Paris and Berlin, a brilliant medievalist who acquired it for one of Germany's great museums, and a member of the Nazi elite who sold it after it had been confiscated as a work of "degenerate art." Remarkable and riveting, The Portrait of Dr. Gachet illuminates, in dramatic detail, the dynamics of the art market and of culture in our time.

 id : 237215 ISBN : 0393311449  | name : Identity Youth and Crisis  |  description : Identity: Youth and Crisis collects Erik H. Erikson's major essays on topics originating in the concept of the adolescent identity crisis. Identity, Erikson writes, is an unfathomable as it is all-pervasive. It deals with a process that is located both in the core of the individual and in the core of the communal culture. As the culture changes, new kinds of identity questions ariseErikson comments, for example, on issues of social protest and changing gender roles that were particular to the 1960s. Representing two decades of groundbreaking work, the essays are not so much a systematic formulation of theory as an evolving report that is both clinical and theoretical. The subjects range from "creative confusion" in two famous livesthe dramatist George Bernard Shaw and the philosopher William Jamesto the connection between individual struggles and social order. "Race and the Wider Identity" and the controversial "Womanhood and the Inner Space" are included in the collection.

 id : 237224 ISBN : 0921149921  | name : Sir Gawain and the Green Knight - Facing Page Translation  |  description : The fourteenth-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of the greatest classics of English literature, but one of the least accessible to most twentieth-century readers. Written in an obscure dialect, it is far more difficult to digest in the original than are most other late medieval English works. Yet any translation is bound to lose much of the flavour of the original. This edition of the poem offers the original text together with a facing-page translation. With the alliterative Middle English before the reader, James Winny provides a non-alliterative and sensitively literal rendering in modern English. This edition also provides an introduction, explanatory and textual notes, a further note on some words that present particular difficulties, and, in the appendices, two contemporary stories, The Feast of Bricriu and The Knight of the Sword, which provide insight on the poem.

 id : 237284 ISBN : 0375703233  | name : The Complete Walker IV  |  description : For the first time since 1984, we have a new edition of the classic book that Field & Stream called the Hikers Bible. For this version, the celebrated writer and hiker Colin Fletcher has taken on a coauthor, Chip Rawlins, himself an avid outdoorsman and a poet from Wyoming. Together, they have made this fourth edition of The Complete Walker the most informative, entertaining, and thorough version yet. The eighteen years since the publication of The Complete Walker III have seen revolutionary changes in hiking and camping equipment: developments in waterproofing technology, smaller and more durable stoves, lighter boots, more manageable tents, and a wider array of food options. The equipment recommendations are therefore not merely revised and tweaked, but completely revamped. During these two decades we have also seen a deepening of environmental consciousness. Not only has backpacking become more popular, but a whole ethic of responsible outdoorsmanship has emerged. In this book the authors confidently lead us through these technological, ethical, and spiritual changes. Fletcher and Rawlinss thorough appraisal and recommendation of equipment begins with a Ground Plan, a discussion of general hiking preparedness. How much to bring? What are the ideal clothes, food, boots, and tents for your trip? They evaluate each of these variables in detailincluding open, honest critiques and endorsements of brand-name equipment. Their equipment searches are exhaustive; they talk in detail about everything from socks to freeze-dried trail curries. They end as they began, with a philosophical and literary disquisition on the reasons to walk, capped off with a delightful collection of quotes about walking and the outdoor life. After a thoughtful and painstaking analysis of hiking gear from hats to boots, from longjohns to tent flaps, they remind us that ultimately hiking is about the experience of being outdoors and seeing the green world anew. Like its predecessors, The Complete Walker IV is an essential purchase for anyone captivated by the outdoor life.

In her sweeping and magnificent multi-volume work The Hallowed Isle, acclaimed author Diana L. Paxson brilliantly reinvents the classic myth from the unique perspectives of four distinct tribal cultures that shaped Britain in the violent days of the sixth century. Book One: The Book of the Sword Mighty Rome subjugated the isle of Britain only to abandon it, leaving behind a bloody patchwork of warring tribes. To put an end to this conflict, Artoria Argantel--Lady of the Lake and Druid priestess--has called upon the Spirit of War and Justice to deliver a champion who will unite the broken land. A champion who will come from her own ancient and royal blood. For only one man can wield the sword forged from star-steel by ancient spells. Only one man can free the sword from its prison of stone: Artor, a fosterling of unknown parentage...the promised High King. Book Two: The Book of the Spear A Saxon of royal blood, Oesc has fled the drowned, doomed country to which he is heir in order to claim rich lands in Britannia. Though sworn to the spirits of his new home, he truly serves the dark sorcery of an older god--the power of the Spear. But the Spear's magic is opposed by that of the Sword of Rome, the sword wielded by young King Artor and his father Uthir before him. The sword that slew Oesc's own father. Now vengeance burns fiercely in Oesc's heart, a lust for revenge that could destroy a greatness before it fully blooms. Destiny lies in the clashing of magic steel...the hope of all Britannia rests in the hands of the warrior sons. The Arthurian saga is one of the most enduring legends of Western civilization.

Packed with worksheets, detailed plans, and inspiring case studies, Topolnicki's plan helps families set fun priorities while still balancing the checkbook. Whether you want to leave work altogether or continue part-time, this book" is the key to freedom for millions of families trapped on the working-parent treadmill.
 id : 237391 ISBN : 0670032727  | name : Martin Luther  |  description : As the last millennium drew to a close and lists of the most influential people of that time were drawn up, Martin Luther always appeared near the top. Who was this famous rebel? Martin Luther explores the records left by Luther of his inner struggles and his conflicts with the papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, leaders of the emergent Protestant movements, and, in the greatest stains on his reputation, peasants in their uprising and Jews. This is also a portrait of a man of conscience and courage who risked death to witness to his beliefs and whose arguments drew fellow believers who together created changes that altered the destiny of Christendom, the shape of Christianity, and the rise of new freedoms in church and state. Martin Marty -- professor, author, pastor, historian, journalist -- is, in Bill Moyers's words, "the most influential interpreter of American religion." In Martin Luther, Marty sees Luther as someone who was engaged in a lifelong search not only for the grace of God but also for assurance that it was directed toward him. He sought this certainty partly so that he might lead others to explore their consciences, see their faith nurtured, and be ready to take public stands. People of any faith or of no faith can discover in his struggles and affirmations templates for their own paths, and will find him an engrossing subject, a person capable of living with apparent contradictions along with firm convictions.

 id : 237533 ISBN : 0066212677  | name : Sailors to the End  |  description : In the tradition of New York Times bestsellers In Harm's Way and The Terrible Hours comes a mesmerizing, high-adrenaline account of the heroic sailors who survived one of the worst accidents in U.S. naval history. Sailors to the End tells the dramatic and until now forgotten story of the 1967 fire on board the USS Forrestal during its time at Yankee Station off the coast of Vietnam. The aircraft carrier, the mightiest of the U.S. fleet, was preparing to launch attacks into North Vietnam when one of its jets accidentally fired a rocket across the flight deck and into an aircraft occupied by pilot John McCain. A huge fire ensued, and McCain barely escaped before a 1,000-pound bomb on his plane exploded, causing a chain reaction with other bombs on surrounding planes. The crew struggled for days to extinguish the fires, the five thousand men on board experiencing different kinds of hell -- some trapped in damaged compartments waiting to die, some battling rivers of flaming jet fuel in order to rescue their buddies. Almost all of them were innocent eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds, but in an instant they were thrust into a tragedy that nearly destroyed the ship and took the lives of 134 men. Written with the intensity and excitement of a thriller, and based on never-before-disclosed information and extensive interviews with the fire's survivors, here is the first full, minute-by-minute account of the disaster. Told through the stories of a dozen sailors, including John Beling, the carrier's beloved captain who was made a scapegoat for the disaster, Sailors to the End follows the Forrestal from its home in Norfolk, Virginia, through its mission in Vietnam. Focusing on the fateful fire and its aftermath, this book provides a gripping tale of heartache and heroism as young men find themselves trapped on a burning ship with bombs exploding all around them. Sailors to the End also corrects the official view of the fire, providing evidence that the U.S. government compromised the ship's safety by insisting on increased bombing despite the shortage of reliable weapons. For thirty-five years, the terrible loss of life has been blamed on the sailors themselves, but this meticulously documented history shows that they were truly the victims and heroes, deserving recognition for their efforts during a sweeping tragedy that until now has been only a footnote in history. Gregory A. Freeman dramatically brings this story to life, creating a work that is both riveting and moving.

 id : 237538 ISBN : 0887080421  | name : Rooster's Off to See the World  |  description : "One fine morning, a rooster decided he wanted to travel." In strikingly designed, colorful collage illustrations and a beguiling simple text, Eric Carle takes his young readers on a trip with the rooster and his companions. As he travels, the rooster is joined by two cats, three frogs, four turtles and five fish, offering the child a graphic introduction to the meaning of numbers, number sets and addition within the context of an entertaining story. When night falls, the rooster's friends find he has made no provisions for their food or shelter and, disappointed, they abandon the expedition -- once again in sets of five, four, three and two, but this time in a declining series. Finally the rooster, too, decides that he has seen enough of the world and that he is, in fact, a little bit homesick. Eric Carle believes in letting children make learning discoveries at their own pace. This book can be read and enjoyed for its story and its beautiful illustrations alone; however, the child who is ready to begin to think mathematically will find additional pleasures in the opportunities presented in the text, the pictures and the diagrams for learning basic arithmetic concepts.

 id : 237555 ISBN : 0761536604  | name : Global Warming and Other Eco-myths  |  description : Includes essays by Nobel Laureate Dr. Norman E. Borlaug and other noted scientists and scholars The modern environmental movement began with the publication of three seminal works, Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring, Paul Ehrlich's "The Population Bomb, and the Club of Rome's "The Limits to Growth. These books' dismal visions of a poisoned, over-populated, resource-depleted world spiraling down toward environmental collapse are today's conventional wisdom. And every year we hear about new "conclusive" reports from special interest groups claiming that our atmosphere's temperatures are soaring, our air and water are more polluted, our cities are more crowded, and our global food supply is more precarious than ever before. However, according to a number of leading scientists from around the world, members of the environmental movement are guilty of twisting--sometimes manufacturing--the facts in an effort to frighten people into joining their cause. In this eye-opening book, some of the most respected researchers in the country explode the myths behind much of the doom and gloom of today's environmental movement. You will discover how the hysteria about global warming, overpopulation, mass extinctions, imminent famines, biotechnology, energy shortages, and more are grounded not in reason but in false science and a fear of progress. When placed beside the overwhelming facts, some of the most pervasive eco-myths crumble, including: Myth: Antarctica is melting due to global warming--threatening to raise ocean levels Fact: Antarctica has been cooling--and its glaciers thickening--for the past 30 years Myth: The global population is growing faster than our ability toproduce food Fact: Global fertility rates are falling dramatically, and with advanced technology, farmers are producing more food using fewer resources than ever before Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generators Fact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmills Myth: Modern pesticides and fertilizers are increasing the rates of cancer in humans Fact: No study has ever shown that anyone has developed cancer from the legal application of pesticides, and environmental pollution accounts for at most 2 percent of all cancer cases versus 30 percent caused by tobacco use And many more Ultimately, this book shows that uniting much of the environmental movement is an agenda that is not so much anti-pollution as it is anti-human. "Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths lays out the "true state of the planet, which, as you'll discover, is more healthy, vibrant, and clean than ideologically motivated environmentalists want you to believe.

For over twenty years he's played hardball on the streets in what is perhaps the best-known police division in America, and he brings to his Fey Croaker novels the kind of authenticity that only an insider could achieve. The murder of Alex Waverly, a highly decorated detective assigned to the LAPD's clandestine Anti-Terrorist Division, appears to be an open-and-shut case of domestic violence turned deadly. Circumstances are not exactly what they seem, however, as Fey Croaker discovers when the chief of police removes responsibility for the investigation from the department's Robbery-Homicide Division and assigns it to her with instructions to wrap it up "quick and tidy. No muss, no fuss." Dropped into the middle of a power struggle between the chief of police and Vaughn Harrison, the department's deputy chief in charge of overseeing specialized investigation units -- including Robbery-Homicide Division and Alex Waverly's Anti-Terrorist Division -- Fey is torn between her loyalty to the Old Guard and following the razor's edge of integrity in a world filled with lies and deceptions. Struggling to overcome her personal demons, especially the death of her lover, Fey and her appealing crew, the dynamic Arch Hammersmith and Rhonda Lawless (a.k.a. Hammer and Nails), Brindle Jones, Abraham Cohen (a.k.a. Alphabet), and Fey's second-in-command Monk Lawson, courageously search for the truth, no matter what the cost. Racing to stay ahead of the rising body count, they quickly become moving targets in their struggle to stop a south-of-the-border terrorist from striking at the very heart of Los Angeles. Riveting in its plausibility, Tequila Mockingbird confirms Paul Bishop's place among the best of the police thriller writers and shows Fey Croaker and her team at the top of their form. Welcome aboard, fans of Joseph Wambaugh and William Caunitz. Paul Bishop has arrived.

Armand, who first appeared in all his dark glory more than twenty years ago in the now-classic Interview with the Vampire, the first of The Vampire Chronicles, the novel that established its author worldwide as a magnificent storyteller and creator of magical realms. Now, we go with Armand across the centuries to the Kiev Rus of his boyhood - a ruined city under Mongol dominion - and to ancient Constantinople, where Tartar raiders sell him into slavery. And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood. As the novel races to its climax, moving through scenes of luxury and elegance, of ambush, fire, and devil worship to nineteenth-century Paris and today's New Orleans, we see its eternally vulnerable and romantic hero forced to choose between his twilight immortality and the salvation of his immortal soul.

Malgré la tendresse, malgré l'affection et l'espérance, deux êtres qui ont fait un bout de chemin ensemble se retrouvent un jour face à face, incapables de communiquer, d'ouvrir leur cur, de dévoiler leurs pensées, de se rendre accessibles. Pourquoi et comment en sont-ils arrivés là ? Est-il possible d'améliorer leur relation ? Jacques Salomé, qui anime depuis 20 ans des sessions de formation aux relations humaines, s'est interrogé sur la désintégration des couples. Dans son livre, il identifie quelques modalités, quelques processus qui, dans leur ponctualité, n'ont rien de grave ou de dramatique mais qui, répétés et amplifiés, ajoutés les uns aux autres vont constituer, au long des jours, une source renouvelée de pollutions relationnelles et faire obstacle à la communication entre deux partenaires. Mais il ne se borne pas à expliquer l'échec. Il ranime l'espoir en réfléchissant sur des alternatives ouvertes pour développer l'intimité, la conscience et la spontanéité, et créer un espace de négociation afin d'aller plus loin ensemble. Même alors que tout semble s'écrouler, rien n'est jamais tout à fait perdu, soutient-il. "La vie peut être merveilleuse... même si la réalité ne l'est pas." Liv Ulmann

 id : 237713 ISBN : 0201696975  | name : FreeHand 8 for Windows and Macintosh  |  description : Concentrating on ideology and cultural values, Liberty, Virtue, and Progress explores the motivations that casued Northerners to fight America's Civil War. Arguing for the primary significance of ideals and cultural values in defining a war, the book examines the opinions of both the Northernsoldier and civilian about the meaning of the Civil War in terms of defining American nationalism, the character of the American people, and the future of free government. The book addresses the intellectual and social elites of Northern society, but gives a new emphasis to the opinions of thecommon man on the subject and ideology of the war. In addition to identifying and discussing the ideas and cultural values that played a role in motivation, Hess looks at how the experience of war (battlefield death and suffering) interacted with that ideology. Contrary to the commonly held belief that war is disruptive to pre-war ideals, Hessargues that Northern soldiers and civilians made a conscious effort to use ideology as a tool with which to retain their faith in ideas. Liberty, Virtue, and Progress is based on extensive research in both published and unpublished sources.

 id : 237867 ISBN : 1586482475  | name : Idiot Proof  |  description : In 1979 two events occurred that would shape the next twenty-five years. In America and Britain, an era of weary consensus was displaced by the arrival of a political marriage of fiery idealists: Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher transformed politics with a combination of breezy charm and assertive "Victorian values." In Iran, the fundamentalist cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set out to restore a regime that had last existed almost 1,300 years ago. Between them they succeeded in bringing the twentieth century to a premature close. By 1989, Francis Fukuyama was declaring that we had now reached the End of History. What colonized the space recently vacated by notions of history, progress and reason? Cults, quackery, gurus, irrational panics, moral confusion and an epidemic of idiocy, the proof of which was to be found in every state, every work-place, and every library. In Idiot Proof , columnist Francis Wheen brilliantly evokes the key personalities of the post-political eraincluding Princess Diana and Deepak Chopra, Osama bin Laden and Nancy Reagan's astrologerwhile lamenting the extraordinary rise in superstition, relativism and emotional hysteria over the past quarter of a century. In turn comic, indignant, outraged and just plain baffled by the idiocy of it all, Idiot Proof is a masterful depiction of the daftness of our times and a plea that we might just think a little more and believe a little less.

 id : 237870 ISBN : 1400041767  | name : At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig  |  description : A wildly humorous account of the author's travels across ParaguaySouth America's darkly fabled, little-known island surrounded by land. Rarely visited by tourists and barely touched by global village sprawl, Paraguay remains a mystery to outsiders. Think of this small nation and your mind is likely to jump to Nazis, dictators, and soccer. Now, John Gimlettes eye-opening bookequal parts travelogue, history, and unorthodox travel guidebreaches the boundaries of this isolated land, and illuminates a little-understood place and its people. It is a wonderfully animated telling of Paraguay's story: of cannibals, Jesuits, and sixteenth-century Anabaptists; of Victorian Australian socialists and talented smugglers; of dictators and their mad mistresses; bloody wars and Utopian settlements; and of lives transplanted from Japan, Britain, Poland, Russia, Germany, Ireland, Korea, and the United States. The author travels from the insular cities and towns of the east, along ghostly trails through the countryside, to reach the Gran Chaco of the west: the green hell covering almost two-thirds of the country, where 4 percent of the population coexistsmore or very-much-less peacefullywith a vast array of exotic wildlife that includes jaguars, prehistoric lungfish, and their more recently evolved distant cousins, the great fighting river fish. Gimlette visits with Mennonites and the indigenas, arms dealers and real-estate tycoons, shopkeepers, government bureaucrats and, of course, Nazis. Filled with bizarre incident, fascinating anecdote, and richly evocative detail, At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig is a brilliant description of a country of eccentricity and contradiction, of beguilingly individualistic men and women, and of unexpected and extraordinary beauty. It is a vivid, often riotous, always fascinating, journey.

Mike Wilson has interviewed more than a hundred of Ellison's friends and enemies as well as Ellison himself to create an entertaining and provocative portrait of this enigmatic and visionary businessman.

 id : 237906 ISBN : 0306806177  | name : Battles Of The Revolutionary War  |  description : The Americans did not simply outlast the British, nor was the war just a glorified guerrilla action with sporadic skirmishes. Americans won their independence on the battlefield by employing superior strategies, tactics, and leadership. So W. J. Wood contends in this groundbreaking study of the battles of Bunker Hill, Quebec, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, Cowpens, and others. For each engagement he describes the types of combatants on each side and the weapons available to them; outlines the tactics; narrates blow-by-blow accounts; and analyzes the factors that determined the character of the battle and outcome. Battles of the Revolutionary War has been designed for the "armchair strategist." Dozens of illustrations and maps, many specially prepared for this volume, contribute to the overall clarity and insight of Wood's presentation. Anyone with a desire to attain a feel for the dramatic times and colorful personalities that accompanied the birth of this country would do well to read it.

 id : 237915 ISBN : 0836267524  | name : The Bundled Doonesbury With Cd-Rom  |  description : "No one ruffles feathers as consistently as Trudeau, who regularly deals with hot-button topics all within the four panels of his daily comic strip." --Pittsburgh Post Gazette This book-plus package offers a breathtaking view of the Doonesbury universe in one integrated package. Start with the book: a rich, oversize anthology, jam-packed with America's most provocative and pointed satire -- including 80 Sunday strips in full color. From O.J. and Mr. Butts to Whitewater and Tailgate, from Mike, Kim, and Alex's funky software start-up company to Duke and Earl's Las Vegas long shots, Trudeau tracks the fierce strangeness of end-of-century life through the ever-intertwining fortunes of his substantial cast. Bundled with this impressive tome is the Doonesbury Flashbacks CD-ROM, a complete account of all things Doonesbury over the course of the strip's first 25 years. The disc contains more than 9,000 strips, archived with every search mode imaginable -- readers can locate strips by character, topic, chronology, dialogue, or location.

 id : 237918 ISBN : 0688152430  | name : River Angel  |  description : In April, 1991, in a little Wisconsin town about 100 miles southwest of the town where I grew up, a misfit boy was kidnapped by a group of high school kids who, later would testify they only meant to frighten him, to drive him around for a while. Somehow they ended up in the river whooping and hollering on a two lane bridge. Somehow, the boy was shoved, he jumped, he slipped -- accounts vary -- into the icy water. The kids told police they never heard a splash; one reported seeing a brilliant flash of light. (Several people in the area witnessed a similar light, while others recalled hearing something "kind of like thunder.") All night, volunteers walked the rivers edge, but it was dawn before the body was found in a barn a good mile from the bridge. The owner of the barn had been the one to discover the body and she said the boys' cheeks were rosy, his skin warm to the touch. A sweet smell hung in the air. "It was," she said, "as if he were just sleeping" And then she told police she believed an angel had carried him there. A miracle? A hoax? Or something in between? With acute insight and great compassion, A. Manette Ansay captures the inner life of a town and its residents struggling to forge a new identity in the face of a rapidly changing world. The result is a novel of transcendental beauty, an extraordinary portrait of the human soul's longing for grace.
 id : 237919 ISBN : 0836236866  | name : Planet Doonesbury  |  description : No matter what's occurring on the planet, Doonesbury has offered readers a parallel universe. Through the adventures of cherished characters like Mike, J.J., Boopsie, and B.D., Doonesbury has chronicled the course of time with humor and wit. Whether it was an anti-Vietnam march or the Cyber Valley of Seattle, Doonesbury has given readers a hip and happening place to be, if only for a few minutes every day. Created by master cartoonist Garry Trudeau, Doonesbury remains a dynamic force. Its political slant consistently amuses readers, sparks controversy, and frightens editors. Political characters appear frequently--humorously represented by time bombs or waffles--but the strip isn't entirely political. Trudeau deals with young love, broken relationships, and the raising of a few young kids, but the strip isn't really about warm-fuzzies either. For the millions of readers who turn to Doonesbury every day, the strip is simply a favored friend. Controversial yet always contemporary; familiar but rarely perfectly comfortable. In this collection, Planet Doonesbury continues the adventures of all the regulars, from Father Duke and his recently revealed son, Earl, to the impending marriage of Mike and Kim. B.D. returns to Vietnam, and with Phred as host, discovers a war of sorts is still being waged--not over changing politics, but the race to make money in the now industrialized country. Presented in an exciting format, the handsome Planet Doonesbury features large-size color Sundays.

 id : 237933 ISBN : 0060193174  | name : Duty First  |  description : Duty First is a penetrating account of a year inside one of America's premier schools for leadership-the United States Military Academy at West Point. Ed Ruggero, a former West Point cadet and professor, takes an incisive look at how this elite school builds the "leaders of character" who will command the nation's military. Ruggero details the struggles of young men and women who will lead the American soldiers of the future. Writing with deep insight and superb narrative skill, he follows their tumultuous lives: the initial, grueling training, the strict student hierarchy and intense classroom work, and the interaction between the lowly first-year plebes and the upper-class cadets who train them. Duty First also shows the role played by the majors, captains, and sergeants, who oversee everything that happens at this unique institution. By taking a close, critical look at the Academy's standards and traditions, Ruggero examines the changes in West Point's approach to leadership training that have sparked controversy among its alumni. While all West Pointers would agree with one graduate's claim that "steel is forged in fire," many worry that the fire has been allowed to cool too much. Does today's Academy produce leaders with the inner steel to fight and win the nation's wars, or are today's cadets being coddled in the interest of political correctness, retention, and diversity? Above the Hudson River to the hot and humid barracks rooms where the nation's future captains struggle, Ruggero combines objective reporting with the emotional perspective of memoir to take readers on a guided tour through the jarring, overwhelming, inspiring leadership school that is West Point. The stories in Duty First widely reverberate far beyond West Point, because while the specific goals and methods of developing leaders differ, the fundamental values courage, commitment, selfless sacrifice - are the same for all leaders, from the parents of small children to the CEOs of major corporations.

The skill requirements include what kind of takeoff and landing must be performed, such as crosswind or short-field; how a steep turn should be executed, with specifics that include what bank angle and airspeed to use; and what areas will be tested on a continuous basis, such as the checklist usage, positive exchange of flight controls, and crew resource management. The tolerances are defined so the candidates know what altitude, airspeed, headings, and banks must be maintained to complete each manoeuvre successfully. Each PTS guide lists the knowledge and experience prerequisites for a particular certificate or rating and provides background information and study and reference materials.

 id : 238104 ISBN : 0743528344  | name : Living History  |  description : Author of the Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller What Happened Hillary Rodham Clintons deeply personal and historically significant memoir about her eight years as First Lady. Hillary Rodham Clinton is known to hundreds of millions of people around the world. She writes with candor, humor, and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady. Living History is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations, and constant public scrutiny. Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrainresponding to the changing times and her own internal compassand became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate, and international icon, she has lived through Americas great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater. The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity, and promote the needs of children and families, as she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of womens rights, human rights, and democracy. Intimate, powerful, and inspiring, Living History captures the essence of one of the most remarkable women of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voiceas a woman and as a formidable figure in American politics.

 id : 238131 ISBN : 0671578464  | name : Eagle Against The Stars  |  description : THE ALIENS PLAYED BY THE RULES. THEIR RULES. When the Lokaron suddenly appeared in the skies of Earth, America was enjoying victory in the off-and-on war that had occupied most of the 20th century. That's why they chose America to occupy and use as their puppet in dominating the planet. We were already set up to do it, now we would do it for them. Not that they were evil; they just insisted that we trade with them. By their rules, rules backed up by irresistible weapons. In terms of those rules, they would even play fair -- but in the long run, if they didn't own something, it would be because they didn't want it. At first we tried to fight, but just as the Japanese, the Chinese, the Hindus and all the rest had learned, when the ones with the guns say "Let's trade!" they really mean "Trade or bleed". And so you trade -- even if you won't have a country -- or a planet -- left when the last round is played out. But worms turn, and just as had the Europeans a century ago, the Lokaron were going to learn a lesson from their victims, a lesson that they weren't going to like one bit....

 id : 238138 ISBN : 0486282155  | name : Short Stories  |  description : In his stories and in such landmark novels as Sister Carrie and An American Tragedy, Theodore Dreiser (18711945) defied literary propriety and broke new ground in American fiction by focusing on life as it is, rather than as it ought to be. Sherwood Anderson, introducing a collection of Dreiser stories, said of him: "If there is a modern movement in American prose writing, a movement toward greater courage and fidelity to life in writing, then Theodore Dreiser is the pioneer and the hero of the movement." Indeed, his bold example paved the way for a new generation of American writers.The five superb stories in this volume vividly attest to the sincerity and depth of Dreiser's gifts as a powerful and original storyteller. They are "Free," the story of a man trying, as his wife lies dying, to understand why he never found happiness in marriage; "The Second Choice" and "Married," two insightful tales of the complex relationships of men and women; "Nigger Jeff," a powerful, disturbing story of a lynching; and "The Lost Phbe," a poignant tale of a man's search for a lost life partner.

What emerges is a new and rich definition of mentor, as it applies to the deeply human art of writing.

 id : 238176 ISBN : 0312268866  | name : Banvard's Folly  |  description : The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated. Paul Collins' Banvard's Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells. Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as "The Three Mile Painting") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed "William Shakespeare" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers. Collins' love for what he calls the "forgotten ephemera of genius" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard's Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.

 id : 238180 ISBN : 0520218965  | name : Life Stories  |  description : "This unusual collection of conversations with leading environmental thinkers breaks down the conventional separation between thinking and living. The presentations of ecological ideas are not only superior but often eloquent and powerful, and incorporate the latest information available. Since many of the chapters give quite full accounts of the interviewees' careers, the book will also provide inspiration to young readers." Ernest Callenbach, author of Ecology: A Pocket Guide "The recurring theme of environmental emergency comes through loud and clear in all of the interviews, but this book also shows that it is people who make things happen, not the great gray 'they' or 'we.' We learn exactly who it was that discovered the hole in the ozone layer and who invented the ideas of Gaia and the Population Bomb. . . . If I had my way I would make this book required reading for students across all disciplines, because its message is profound, urgent, compelling, and relevant to everyone."Anthony J. F. Griffiths, University of British Columbia, Winner of the Genetics Society of Canada Award of Excellence "Life Stories should be required reading. The reverence for life expressed by these heroes is deeply moving. Their fierce determination ought to inspire all of us as we confront the environmental challenges of the new millennium." Denis Hayes, International Chair, Earth Day 2000 "We start the twenty-first century with a heightened awareness that our planet is under stress. Life Stories illustrates that the human spirit has the capacity to set forces in motion that will save our habitat. Heather Newbold introduces us to scientists who have probed the mysteries of our natural systems and taken action so our Earth can heal itself. As we meet them, our own hope for the future is inspired."Peter A. A. Berle, host of The Environment Show on Public Radio "These mini-autobiographies are captivating, challenging, and worrisome. We can successfully meet the challenge, but will we? This is attention-grabbing stuff. Once you start reading this book it will capture and hold you to the last page."Senator Gaylord Nelson, founder of Earth Day

Hunted Past Reason is a major literary event: Matheson's first new novel in seven years-and a gripping tale of madness, paranoia, and murder. It's supposed to be just an ordinary camping trip, two old acquaintances hiking through the wilderness toward a remote cabin in the woods of northern California. Bob Hansen, a middle-aged family man and author, isn't anticipating anything worse than sore muscles and maybe a few chilly nights. But the enforced isolation of the hike soon exposes long-hidden rivalries and resentments between Bob and his guide through the forest, a fading TV actor whom Bob has known for several years. The deeper they get into the primeval wilderness and the farther from civilization, the greater the tension between the two men becomes-until the simmering hostility erupts into a terrifying life-or-death struggle for survival. Two men entered the woods, but only one may emerge alive. Hunted Past Reason is a nail-biting thriller in the classic Matheson tradition.

 id : 238230 ISBN : 0820306819  | name : Baptized in Blood  |  description : Charles Reagan Wilson documents that for over half a century there existed not one, but two civil religions in the United States, the second not dedicated to honoring the American nation. Extensively researched in primary sources, Baptized in Blood is a significant and well-written study of the Souths civil religion, one of two public faiths in America. In his comparison, Wilson finds the Lost Cause offered defeated Southerners a sense of meaning and purpose and special identity as a precarious but distinct culture. Southerners may have abandoned their dream of a separate political nation after Appomattox, but they preserved their cultural identity by blending Christian rhetoric and symbols with the rhetoric and imagery of Confederate tradition. Civil religion has been defined as the religious dimension of a people that enables them to understand a historical experience in transcendent terms. In this light, Wilson explores the role of religion in postbellum southern culture and argues that the profound dislocations of Confederate defeat caused southerners to think in religious terms about the meaning of their unique and tragic experience. The defeat in a war deemed by some as religious in nature threw into question the Souths relationship to God; it was interpreted in part as a God-given trial, whereby suffering and pain would lead Southerners to greater virtue and strength and even prepare them for future crusades. From this reflection upon history emerged the civil religion of the Lost Cause. While recent work in southern religious history has focused on the Old South period, Wilsons timely study adds to our developing understanding of the South after the Civil War. The Lost Cause movement was an organized effort to preserve the memory of the Confederacy. Historians have examined its political, literary, and social aspects, but Wilson uses the concepts of anthropology, sociology, and historiography to unveil the Lost Cause as an authentic expression of religion. The Lost Cause was celebrated and perpetuated with its own rituals, mythology, and theology; as key celebrants of the religion of the Lost Cause, Southern ministers forged it into a religious movement closely related to their own churches. In examining the role of civil religion in the cult of the military, in the New South ideology, and in the spirit of the Lost Cause colleges, as well as in other aspects, Wilson demonstrates effectively how the religion of the Lost Cause became the institutional embodiment of the Souths tragic experience.

County officials kept Sandy in jail while they awaited the trial, despite ballistic evidence that strongly suggested she hadn't fired the fatal shot. The case erupted into an epic struggle between Sandy - who was poor, different, and a woman - and the "good old boys" of Lincoln County, Oregon, who held all the power." "Though the Joneses' guilt seemed eminently clear to the county and the prosecution, Gerry Spence, renowned for his work on the cases of Karen Silkwood and Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, took the case pro bono and the courtroom battle exploded into three years of intensely moving jury trials, recounted here from the record of the case. The Smoking Gun follows Gerry Spence through his passionate arguments with two different judges and two different prosecutional teams, his exacting jury selection, his expert questioning of the witnesses, and his incredible rapport with the jury as he fights for the rights of Sandy and her son."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

But within the Vatican there were serious disagreements about the time of death, who found the body, and the true state of the Popes health prior to his death. These arguments led to rumors of foul play and conspiracyvariously involving the KGB, the Freemasons, crooked financiers, and Vatican officials.

 id : 238280 ISBN : 0140445617  | name : Don Quixote  |  description : Miguel de Cervantes's mock-epic masterwork, Don Quixote was voted the greatest book of all time by the Nobel Institute, and this Penguin Classics edition is translated with an introduction and notes by John Rutherford. Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading romances of chivalry that he determines to become a knight errant and pursue bold adventures, accompanied by his squire, the cunning Sancho Panza. As they roam the world together, the aging Quixote's fancy leads them wildly astray, tilting at windmills, fighting with friars, and distorting the rural Spanish landscape into a fantasy of impenetrable fortresses and wicked sorcerers. At the same time the relationship between the two men grows in fascinating subtlety. Often considered to be the first modern novel, Don Quixote is a wonderful burlesque of the popular literature its disordered protagonist is obsessed with. John Rutherford's landmark translation does full justice to the energy and wit of Cervantes's prose, and this edition of Don Quixote won the 2002 Premio Valle Inclan prize for translation. His introduction discusses the traditional works parodied in Don Quixote and issues of literary translation. Miguel de Cervantes Saaverda's (1547-1616) life was occupied with a struggle to earn a livelihood from literature and humble government employment. As well as Don Quixote, he wrote a number of plays and a collection of highly accomplished short stories, Exemplary Tales (1613). If you enjoyed Don Quixote, you might like Homer's Odyssey, also available in Penguin Classics. 'John Rutherford makes Don Quixote funny and readable ... His Quixote can be pompous, imposingly learned, secretly fearful, mad and touching.' Colin Burrow, The Times Literary Supplement

Almost universally neglected in such systems are the -- often unrecognised -- barriers which prevent knowledge and understanding.

Building on the foundations laid in Learning how to Learn and The Commanding Self, Idries Shah in Knowing how to Know illuminates those factors. Like an ultra-violet light shone onto the petals of flowers, it reveals concealed patterns, normally invisible to our customary modes of thought. -- Publisher description.

 id : 238434 ISBN : 0609804839  | name : Emotionally Intelligent Parenting  |  description : Have you, as a parent, ever found yourself treating your children in a way you would never tolerate from someone else? The authors of Emotionally Intelligent Parenting call for a new Golden Rule: Do unto your children as you would have other people do unto your children. And most important, they show us how to live by it. Based upon extensive research, firsthand experience, and case studies, Emotionally Intelligent Parenting breaks the mold of traditional parenting books by taking into account the strong role of emotions -- those of parents and children -- in psychological development. With this book, parents will learn how to communicate with children on a deeper, more gratifying level and how to help them successfully navigate the intricacies of relating to others. The authors take the five basic principles of Daniel Goleman's best-seller, Emotional Intelligence, and explain how they can be applied to successful parenting.

 id : 238439 ISBN : 1403306184  | name : It's My Heaven  |  description : Do you question the spiritual direction of America, the violence in schools, shopping centers and churches? Do you have questions about your church and the doctrines being taught, or perhaps, the doctrines not being taught? Then you're not alone! There are millions who question the institution of religion. ONE KINGDOM, ONE KING is a search for the church or the body that Jesus Christ said He would build. There are as many as 450 organized religions and denominations who claim to be the true church and who claim to be the path to heaven, but just who or what is the true church? What does its organization look like? The issues of Sabbath changing to Sunday and the celebration of Christmas and Easter; doctrines of the trinity, immortality of the soul, and ever-burning hell; and the role of Israel both past and present are covered, plus others. Many of these subjects are misunderstood or just plain rejected by most denominations. There are many people, if challenged, who would respond if these subjects were explained in simple English. Many just simply have never been taught by their Pentecostal preachers. And other folks are being lied to by the 'professional' religious elite! ONE KINGDOM, ONE KING is a very small investment for a wealth of knowledge--knowledge that Lucifer the devil doesn't want you to find out. What do you have to lose by taking time to read? An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. Find out what the world of man's religion does not want you to learn. Connect what American religion is doing today to what the Holy Bible says and what is happening in America. The obvious will become apparent!

And what kinky games of his own devising they will play. For Aurora, everything that Charles asks is a small price to pay to become the woman she's always dreamed of being. Or is it?

Here, as in her earlier collections, the stories, whether realistic or fanciful, are distinguished by their intensity and their impeccable attention to the nuances of language. Her characters confront inner demons, playing out fantasies they crave and dread. subversions and perversions with wicked wit and psychological acuity.In the title novella, Koslowski, beset by a kind of survivor's guilt, insists to the point of absurdity that his elaborate dental work is emblematic of his immigrant parents' suffering in a German concentration camp and in the siege of Leningrad.

Schwartz, an award-winning writer, has been lauded for her precisely observed domestic dramas and comedies and described as having an anthropologist's eye for her characters and their stories. This collection will give further resonance to her already distinguished literary reputation.

 id : 238496 ISBN : 0060616296  | name : The Historical Jesus  |  description : "He comes as yet unknown into a hamlet of Lower Galilee. He is watched by the cold, hard eyes of peasants living long enough at a subsistence level to know exactly where the line is drawn between poverty and destitution. He looks like a beggar yet his eyes lack the proper cringe, his voice the proper whine, his walk the proper shuffle. He speaks about the rule of God and they listen as much from curiosity as anything else. They know all about rule and power, about kingdom and empire, but they know it in terms of tax and debt, malnutrition and sickness, agrarian oppression and demonic possession. What, they really want to know, can this kingdom of God do for a lame child, a blind parent, a demented soul screaming its tortured isolation among the graves that mark the edges of the village?"  from "The Gospel of Jesus," overture to The Historical Jesus The Historical Jesus reveals the true Jesuswho he was, what he did, what he said. It opens with "The Gospel of Jesus," Crossan's studied determination of Jesus' actual words and actions stripped of any subsequent additions and placed in a capsule account of his life story. The Jesus who emerges is a savvy and courageous Jewish Mediterranean peasant, a radical social revolutionary, with a rhapsodic vision of economic, political, and religious egalitarianism and a social program for creating it. The conventional wisdom of critical historical scholarship has long held that too little is known about the historical Jesus to say definitively much more than that he lived and had a tremendous impact on his followers. "There were always historians who said it could not be done because of historical problems," writes Crossan. "There were always theologians who said it should not be done because of theological objections. And there were always scholars who said the former when they meant the latter.' With this groundbreaking work, John Dominic Crossan emphatically sweeps these notions aside. He demonstrates that Jesus is actually one of the best documented figures in ancient history; the challenge is the complexity of the sources. The vivid portrayal of Jesus that emerges from Crossan's unique methodology combines the complementary disciplines of social anthropology, GrecoRoman history, and the literary analysis of specific pronouncements, anecdotes, confessions and interpretations involving Jesus. All three levels cooperate equally and fully in an effective synthesis that provides the most definitive presentation of the historical Jesus yet attained.

And then they glimpse him in the night: the Iron Giant, taller than a house, with glowing headlight eyes and an insatiable taste for metal. The hungry giant must be stopped at any cost. Only a young boy named Hogarth is brave enough to lead the Iron Giant to a safe home. And only Hogarth knows where to turn when a space-bat as big as Australia, hungry for every living thing on Earth, darkens the sky. First published in 1968, Ted Hughes's classic tale is a powerful tribute to peace on earthand in all the universe. Of it Madeleine L'Engle wrote, "How grateful we should be for Ted Hughes's brilliant The Iron Giant. It speaks to all ages, and we need its message even more now." Philip Pullman called it "so gripping that when you begin to read it aloud, everyone stops to listen, young children and old people alike." Whether you think of it as a science fiction fantasy or a modern fairy tale or a tall-tale parable for today, you will never forget it.

"Working in the "fantastic" satiric tradition of Wells, Orwell, and Vonnegut, Capek chronicles the discovery of a colony of highly intelligent giant salamanders off the coast of an Indonesian island. Capek sardonically details all the reactions of the civilized world - from horror to skepticism, from intellectual fascination to mercantile opportunism - and the ultimate destruction from which it (and the newts) might not escape." --Book Jacket.

 id : 238538 ISBN : 0684813386  | name : Source of Light  |  description : Here is the second volume of A Great Circle, the highly acclaimed Mayfield family trilogy, from one of America's literary treasures. Though a novel independent from The Surface of Earth, The Source of Light continues the saga of the Mayfield family, here focusing on Hutchins Mayfield, whose desire for self-knowledge removes him from his secure existence as a prep school teacher and takes him on a journey to Oxford and Italy to study and write. Hutchins comes back home for a family crisis but ultimately returns to England, where he achieves a maturity that enables him to cope with commitments, abandonments, and the creation of an honest personal agenda. In The Source of Light, Reynolds Price combines gravity and buoyancy, a mythic sense of the past with the mysteries of place, to forge an encompassing portrait of the strange and various world one travels through in the quest for self-fulfillment.

 id : 238544 ISBN : 0226393747  | name : Pictures from an Institution  |  description : Beneath the unassuming surface of a progressive women's college lurks a world of intellectual pride and pomposity awaiting devastation by the pens of two brilliant and appalling wits. Randall Jarrell's classic novel was originally published to overwhelming critical acclaim in 1954, forging a new standard for campus satire--and instantly yielding comparisons to Dorothy Parker's razor-sharp barbs. Like his fictional nemesis, Jarrell cuts through the earnest conversations at Benton College--mischievously, but with mischief nowhere more wicked than when crusading against the vitriolic heroine herself. "A most literate account of a group of most literate people by a writer of power. . . . A delight of true understanding."--Wallace Stevens "I'm greatly impressed by the real fun, the incisive satire, the closeness of observation, and in the end by a kind of sympathy and human warmth. It's a remarkable book."--Robert Penn Warren "Move over Dorothy Parker. Pictures . . . is less a novel than a series of poisonous portraits, set pieces, and endlessly quotable put-downs. Read it less for plot than sharp satire, Jarrell's forte."--Mary Welp "One of the wittiest books of modern times."--New York Times "[T]he father of the modern campus novel, and the wittiest of them all. Extraordinary to think that 'political correctness' was so deliciously dissected 50 years ago."--Noel Malcolm, Sunday Telegraph "A sustained exhibition of wit in the great tradition. . . . Immensely and very devastatingly shrewd."--Edmund Fuller, Saturday Review "[A] work of fiction, and a dizzying and brilliant work of social and literary criticism. Not only 'a unique and serious joke-book,' as Lowell called it, but also a meditation made up of epigrams."--Michael Wood

 id : 238549 ISBN : 0375714634  | name : Peanuts  |  description : This beautiful album will dazzle fans of Charles M. Schulz and his art, providing an unprecedented look at the work of the most brilliant and beloved cartoonist of the twentieth century. Here is the whole gangCharlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy, Peppermint Patty, Schroeder, Pig-Pen, and all the others from the original Peanuts strips. More than five hundred comic strips are reproduced, as well as such rare or never-before-seen items as a sketchbook from Schulz's army days in the early 1940s; his very first printed strip, Just Keep Laughing; his private scrapbook of pre-Peanuts Li'l Folks strips; developmental sketches for the first versions of Charlie Brown and the other Peanuts characters; a sketchbook from 1963; and many more materials gathered from the Schulz archives in Santa Rosa, California. The art has been stunningly photographed by Geoff Spear in full color, capturing the subtle textures of paper, ink, and line. The stripswhich were shot only from the original art or vintage newsprintreveal how, from the 1950s through 2000, Schulz's style and the Peanuts world evolved. The book features an introduction by Jean Schulz and has been designed and edited by renowned graphic artist Chip Kidd, who also provides an informed and appreciative commentary. This celebration of the genius of the most revered cartoonist of our time is a must for anyone who has ever come under the spell of Peanuts.
 id : 238550 ISBN : 096463919X  | name : Sculptured Knits  |  description : Jean Moss takes us on a journey through the decorative arts of the twentieth century, sharing her insights and design inspirations. The decorative arts are "a wonderful source for the knitwear designer: architecture, theater, furniture, ceramics, textiles, jewelry, fashion, and posters all carry the distinctive signatures of their time and creator." The designs take on extra meaning as we read Jean's often informative, occasionally quirky commentary. The journey starts at the turn of the century with the opulence and sinuous arabesques of the Belle Époque. Moving on to the twenties, these curving lines turn sleek and sophisticated with the growth of Art Deco. Our next stop revisits the vibrant offbeat styles of Pop Art in the swinging sixties. Finally, to mark the new millennium, Jean looks with confident eclecticism to sources as diverse as ethnic symbolism and fisher ganseys to create a timeless capsule of contemporary classics that are a pleasure to knit. --From publisher description.

 id : 238565 ISBN : 0679602453  | name : The Charterhouse of Parma  |  description : Balzac considered it the most important French novel of his time. Andre Gide later deemed it the greatest of all French novels, and Henry James judged it to be a masterpiece. Now, in a major literary event, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and distinguished translator Richard Howard presents a new rendition of Stendhal's epic tale of romance, adventure, and court intrigue set in early nineteenth-century Italy. The Charterhouse of Parma chronicles the exploits of Fabrizio del Dongo, an ardent young aristocrat who joins Napoleon's army just before the Battle of Waterloo. Yet perhaps the novel's most unforgettable characters are the hero's beautiful aunt, the alluring Duchess of Sanseverina, and her lover, Count Mosca, who plot to further Fabrizio's political career at the treacherous court of Parma in a sweeping story that illuminates an entire epoch of European history. "Stendhal has written The Prince up to date, the novel that Machiavelli would write if he were living banished from Italy in the nineteenth century," noted Balzac in his famous review of The Charterhouse of Parma. "Never before have the hearts of princes, ministers, courtiers, and women been depicted like this. . . . One sees perfection in every detail. . . . [It] has the magnitude of a canvas fifty feet by thirty, and at the same time the manner, the execution, is Dutch in its minuteness. . . . The Charterhouse of Parma often contains a whole book in a single page. . . . It is a masterpiece." This edition includes original illustrations by Robert Andrew Parker and Notes and a Translator's Afterword by Richard Howard.

A celebrated caricaturist for Punch magazine, Du Maurier's drawings for the novel--of which hismost significant are included here--form a large part of its appeal.

 id : 238580 ISBN : 0226677168  | name : A Dance to the Music of Time  |  description : Anthony Powell's universally acclaimed epic encompasses a four-volume panorama of twentieth century London. Hailed by Time as "brilliant literary comedy as well as a brilliant sketch of the times," A Dance to the Music of Time opens just after World War I. Amid the fever of the 1920s and the first chill of the 1930s, Nick Jenkins and his friends confront sex, society, business, and art. In the second volume they move to London in a whirl of marriage and adulteries, fashions and frivolities, personal triumphs and failures. These books "provide an unsurpassed picture, at once gay and melancholy, of social and artistic life in Britain between the wars" (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.). The third volume follows Nick into army life and evokes London during the blitz. In the climactic final volume, England has won the war and must now count the losses. In the background of this second volume of A Dance to the Music of Time, the rumble of distant events in Germany and Spain presages the storm of World War II. In England, even as the whirl of marriages and adulteries, fashions and frivolities, personal triumphs and failures gathers speed, men and women find themselves on the brink of fateful choices. Includes these novels: At Lady Molly's Casanova's Chinese Restaurant The Kindly Ones "Anthony Powell is the best living English novelist by far. His admirers are addicts, let us face it, held in thrall by a magician."Chicago Tribune "A book which creates a world and explores it in depth, which ponders changing relationships and values, which creates brilliantly living and diverse characters and then watches them grow and change in their milieu. . . . Powell's world is as large and as complex as Proust's."Elizabeth Janeway, New York Times "One of the most important works of fiction since the Second World War. . . . The novel looked, as it began, something like a comedy of manners; then, for a while, like a tragedy of manners; now like a vastly entertaining, deeply melancholy, yet somehow courageous statement about human experience."Naomi Bliven, New Yorker

 id : 238583 ISBN : 156731600X  | name : On Writers & Writing  |  description : "All my life," John Gardner wrote, weeks before his death in a motorcycle accident, "I've lived flat-out. As a motorcycle racer, chemist, writer ... I was never cautious." This goes for John Gardner the critic as well, and that is nowhere more evident than in the pieces collected in this book. On Writers and Writing brings together, for the first time, John Gardner's essays and reviews on his fellow writers and reaffirms his status as one of the most intelligent, generous, and insightful critics of his generation. In piece after piece we see Gardner, the consummate teacher and critic, separating novelistic wheat from chaff, genuine fiction from fakery, examining the work of writers he admires - Saul Bellow, Vladimir Nabokov, Philip Roth, John Cheever, Larry Woiwode, and Joyce Carol Oates - as he would an assignment by one of his students. "Often," Charles Johnson says in his introduction, "the effect is shocking - he said that about John Updike? - but it is a testament to Gardner's professionalism that publicity and public acclaim never blinded him to the basic question every reviewer and critic must ask: What exactly do we have here?" That deceptively simple question is asked insistently throughout many of the pieces collected here, so that the reader too sees the craft and skill of some of America's greatest writers at work. In other essays, Gardner turns his extraordinary intelligence to subjects ranging from fairy tales and religion to King Arthur and Walt Disney. Chock full of insights and opinions, making it essential reading for anyone interested in American literature, On Writers and Writing is also an invaluable contribution to our understanding of John Gardner.

 id : 238623 ISBN : 0679737448  | name : One of Ours  |  description : Willa Cather's Pulitzer Prize-winning narrative of the making of a young American soldier. Claude Wheeler, the sensitive, aspiring protagonist of this beautifully modulated novel, resembles the youngest son of a peculiarly American fairy tale. His fortune is ready-made for him, but he refuses to settle for it. Alienated from his crass father and pious mother, all but rejected by a wife who reserves her ardor for missionary work, and dissatisfied with farming, Claude is an idealist without an ideal to cling to. It is only when his country enters the First World War that Claude finds what he has been searching for all his life. In One of Ours Willa Cather explores the destiny of a grandchild of the pioneers, a young Nebraskan whose yearnings impel him toward a frontier bloodier and more distant than the one that vanished before his birth. In doing so, she creates a canny and extraordinarily vital portrait of an American psyche at once skeptical and romantic, restless and heroic.

 id : 238629 ISBN : 0061092185  | name : Men at Arms  |  description : It was a dwarf's dream. Captain Vimes of the Watch was retiring. That put Corporal Carrot in charge of the new recruits guarding Ankh-Morpork, Discworld's greatest city, from the Barbarian Tribes, Miscellaneous Marauders, unlicensed Thieves, and such. It was a big job, particularly for an adopted dwarf who was so homesick for the gold mines of Ramtop that he often locked himself in the dark room and hit himself on the head with an axe-handle, just for fun. It was a young lord's nightmare. Edward, the 37th Lord d'Eath, newly graduated from the School for Assassins (the ideal institution for those whose rank is higher than their intelligence), had made an astonishing discovery. Ankh-Morpork, kingless for generations, and ruled by Disorganized Crime, had a sovereign! The new king just had to be convinces that he was, in fact, a king. Corporal Carrot had a job. Lord d'Eath had a Task. And so began the most awesome epic encounter of all time, or at least all afternoon, in which good and evil, greed and honor, trolls and dwarves, dogs and bells and swamp dragons would clash, crash, toll, bark, shimmer, and simmer. The fate of a city, indeed a kingdom--nay, a very universe!--was to depend on a young man's courage, an ancient sword's magic, and three-legged poodle's bladder. Don't look so surprised. This is Discworld, where anything can happen. Which means that everything always does.

 id : 238648 ISBN : 0674697375  | name : Pragmatism, a New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking ; The Meaning of Truth, a Sequel to Pragmatism  |  description : Pragmatism is the most famous single work of American philosophy. Its sequel, The Meaning of Truth, is its imperative and inevitable companion. The definitive texts of both works are here available for the first time in one volume, with an introduction by the distinguished contemporary philosopher A. J. Ayer. In Pragmatism James attacked the transcendental, rationalist tradition in philosophy and tried to clear the ground for the doctrine he called radical empiricism. When first published, the book caused an uproar. It was greeted with praise, hostility, ridicule. Determined to clarify his views, James collected nine essays he had written on this subject before he wrote Pragmatism and six written later in response to criticisms by Bertrand Russell and others. He published The Meaning of Truth in 1909, the year before his death. These two works show James at his best full of verve and good humor. Intent upon making difficult ideas clear, he is characteristically vigorous in his effort to make them prevail.

Before Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) wrote Eugene Onegin, his nations literature was a parochial one; after he wrote it, due in no small part to its power and influence, the Russian tradition became one of the central traditions of Western civilization.

 id : 238711 ISBN : 0385029004  | name : Saint Francis of Assisi  |  description : Francis of Assisi is, after Mary of Nazareth, the greatest saint in the Christian calendar, and one of the most influential men in the whole of human history. By universal acclaim, this biography by G. K. Chesterton is considered the best appreciation of Francis's life--the one that gets to the heart of the matter. For Chesterton, Francis is a great paradoxical figure, a man who loved women but vowed himself to chastity; an artist who loved the pleasures of the natural world as few have loved them, but vowed himself to the most austere poverty, stripping himself naked in the public square so all could see that he had renounced his worldly goods; a clown who stood on his head in order to see the world aright. Chesterton gives us Francis in his world-the riotously colorful world of the High Middle Ages, a world with more pageantry and romance than we have seen before or since. Here is the Francis who tried to end the Crusades by talking to the Saracens, and who interceded with the emperor on behalf of the birds. Here is the Francis who inspired a revolution in art that began with Giotto and a revolution in poetry that began with Dante. Here is the Francis who prayed and danced with pagan abandon, who talked to animals, who invented the creche.

 id : 238714 ISBN : 080707702X  | name : The Jefferson Bible  |  description : "We must reduce our volume to the simple evangelists, select, even from them, the very words only of Jesus. There will be remaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man."--Thomas Jefferson Featuring an introduction by Forrest Church, this reissue of "The Jefferson Bible" offers extraordinary insight into the logic of Thomas Jefferson and the Gospel of Jesus. Working in the White House in 1804, Jefferson set out to edit the Gospels in order to uncover the essence of true religion in the simple story of the life of Jesus. Jefferson was convinced that the authentic message of Jesus could be found only by extracting from the Gospels Jesus's message of absolute love and service, rather than the miracle of the Annunciation, Virgin Birth, or even the Resurrection. Completed in 1819, this little book is the remarkable result of Jefferson's efforts.
 id : 238715 ISBN : 2070382931  | name : A la recherche du temps perdu  |  description : Les parties blanches de barbes jusque-là entièrement noires rendaient mélancolique le paysage humain de cette matinée, comme les premières feuilles jaunes des arbres alors qu'on croyait encore pouvoir compter sur un long été, et qu'avant d'avoir commencé d'en profiter on voit que c'est déjà l'automne. Alors moi qui depuis mon enfance, vivant au jour le jour et ayant reçu d'ailleurs de moi-même et des autres une impression définitive, je m'aperçus pour la première fois, d'après les métamorphoses qui s'étaient produites dans tous ces gens, du temps qui avait passé pour eux, ce qui me bouleversa par la révélation qu'il avait passé aussi pour moi. Et indifférente en elle-même, leur vieillesse me désolait en m'avertissant des approches de la mienne.

Le narrateur fait lentement naufrage, enlisé dans la solitude et la maladie, frôlé par la folie. Et là, sous l'il indifférent des insectes qui se livrent autour de lui à d'effroyables carnages, et des habitants qui marinent dans la chaleur comme un sombre bestiaire fainéant, l'auteur reconstruit, avec patience et ironie, un monde luxuriant et poétique. Au fil des chapitres, il observe et nous apprend à voir le spectacle mystérieux de ce monde des ombres d'où émergent d'étonnants portraits. Ainsi le lecteur participe à une sorte d'envoûtement dans ce récit bourré comme un pétard d'humour, de sagesse et d'espoir.
 id : 238724 ISBN : 0486202364  | name : Scepticism and Animal Faith  |  description : In this work, Santayana analyzes the nature of the knowing process and demonstrates by means of clear, powerful arguments how we know and what validates our knowledge. The central concept of his philosophy is found in a careful discrimination between the awareness of objects independent of our perception and the awareness of essences attributed to objects by our mind, or between what Santayana calls the realm of existents and the realm of subsistents. Since we can never be certain that these attributes actually inhere in a substratum of existents, skepticism is established as a form of belief, but animal faith is shown to be a necessary quality of the human mind. Without this faith there could be no rational approach to the necessary problem of understanding and surviving in this world. Santayana derives this practical philosophy from a wide and fascinating variety of sources. He considers critically the positions of such philosophers as Descartes, Euclid, Hume, Kant, Parmenides, Plato, Pythagoras, Schopenhauer, and the Buddhist school as well as the assumptions made by the ordinary man in everyday situations. Such matters as the nature of belief, the rejection of classical idealism, the nature of intuition and memory, symbols and myth, mathematical reality, literary psychology, the discovery of essence, sublimation of animal faith, the implied being of truth, and many others are given detailed analyses in individual chapters.

Combining the goals that William Bennett enumerated as Secretary of Education, key excerpts from E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Sequence, and the latest research, it sets forth clear curricula and specific objectives for children from kindergarten through the eighth grade, including: -What children should be studying and the kind of work they should be doing -Important facts to learn and essential reading lists -When children should master specific math skills, spelling and grammar basics, and scientific facts -Test preparation, homework, and other areas that require parental involvement The Educated Child also examines timely issues such as school choice, sex education, character education, and the phonics/whole language debate. Perhaps most important, it encourages parents to become advocates for their children by learning what to look for in a good school, how to talk to educators, and how, when necessary, to push for needed changes. For parents concerned about their children's current education and future lives, it is the ultimate handbook.

À six heures et vingt-sept minutes, en ce 1er janvier 1975, Alfred Archibald Jones, tout de velours côtelé vêtu, était assis dans un break Cavalier Musketeer, rempli de vapeurs d'essence, le visage sur le volant, à espérer que la sentence divine ne serait pas trop sévère. Prostré, les mâchoires relâchées, les bras en croix comme quelque ange déchu, le poing refermé d'un côté (gauche) sur ses médailles militaires, de l'autre (droit) sur son certificat de mariage, pour la bonne raison qu'il avait décidé d'emporter ses erreurs avec lui. Il avait joué à pile ou face et s'était tenu sans défaillir au verdict du hasard. Il s'agissait là d'un suicide mûrement réfléchi. Mieux, d'une résolution de nouvel an.' Maniant le loufoque, la satire et l'humour avec un art consommé, Zadie Smith produit ici un premier roman détonant, qui frappe par son ambition et son extraordinaire énergie. Ajoutons l'actualité des sujets abordés et la vitalité d'une prose qui se colore de tous les accents de la terre." [Source : 4e de couv.]

 id : 238798 ISBN : 0312245572  | name : The Haunting of Torre Abbey  |  description : "Watson, do you believe in ghosts?" With this question, Sherlock Holmes shatters the calm of a quiet evening in their London flat and, with Dr. John Watson at his side, embarks upon a particularly strange case. Holmes has received a request for aid from Lord Charles Cary, whose family is seemingly being threatened by ghosts in and around the family manor. The manor is Torre Abbey, a twelfth-century monastery in Torquay, Devon, and it has a long history of hauntings. While skeptical of the supernatural, Holmes does believe that the Cary family is in danger-a belief which proves to be horrifyingly accurate when, shortly after they arrive at Torre Abbey, a household member dies suddenly, mysteriously, and seemingly of fright. As strange sightings and threatening apparitions become almost commonplace, Holmes must uncover the secrets of the haunted abbey and the family that lives there if he is to have any hope of protecting the living and avenging the dead. In a case that taxes his wits, and seems beyond the reach of his usual methods, Holmes must grapple with his most deadly and unforgiving foe.

 id : 238806 ISBN : 0752847201  | name : Blitzed!  |  description : Steve Strange was head boy of the New Romantic movement. He ran the best clubs in London: Billy's, Blitz and Camden Palace, which defined the glitzy banality of the era; places where Spandau Ballet and Boy George came to life. He was the glamourpuss of glamourpusses, the campest boy in town. He formed, with Midge Ure, Visage, which became one of the biggest bands of the time, selling millions of records and gaining tabloid notoriety. This work recounts the rise and fall of the Blitz Kid himself and recounts from the epicentre the excess of the early eighties: the clubs, the people, the music, the money, his time spent recovering in Ibiza and India, the subsequent steady decline into cocaine and heroin abuse and his rise back to sanity. Steve recounts how he lost all his possessions in a house fire and days later learned of the death of his close friend Michael Hutchence. Within a couple of years Paula Yates had also committed suicide and Strange had ended up back in South Wales, homeless, mentally unstable and facing a court order for shoplifting. Somehow he managed to pull himself back from the brink.

Videogames are here to stay. It is now more than a quarter of a century since the appearance of the first commercially available videogame, Pong. Now the profits on blockbuster games are measured in terms of the first weekend's millions, like those of mass-market films. Sony estimates that nearly 1 in 5 UK households has a Playstation; worldwide sales of its console have topped 30 million. Videogame design is now the subject of accredited BSc degrees at universities. The market domination by British based videogame companies is one of the success stories of the decade. Yet videogames are still seen as a compromised art-form, derivative at best, actively harmful at worst. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole asks the question: If this is an artform, what kind of an artform is it? Where did it come from, and where is it going?

 id : 238851 ISBN : 0740726730  | name : The Legal Lampoon  |  description : When he launched Non Sequitur a decade ago, Wiley Miller knew he didn't want a running joke. So he took the name of his strip from the Latin phrase for "it does not follow" and created a comic that features no central character or theme, no setting or time frame, just a Twilight Zone of cartoon moments. Day after day, Non Sequitur hilariously jabs at the feats and foibles of life, skewering everyone from doctors to politicians. Wiley's irreverent, satirical wit, combined with his superbly crafted illustrations, confirms once and for all that the universe is one big joke at humanity's expense.In Wiley's world, no one is a better target than lawyers. That's why The Legal Lampoon, a collection of the cream of Non Sequitur's legal cartoon crop, will be one of the Wiley's most popular books.Consider the poor panhandler standing next to a signboard that reads, "Stood on principle. Won my lawsuit. Went bankrupt." Or the Master of Spin, responding to his client's lost appeal to the parole board: "Congratulations! You've been held over by popular demand . . ." Or a fund-raiser who can't get any donations until she edits her sign to read: "Donations to spay and neuter stray pets and lawyers." Throughout the pages of The Legal Lampoon, lawyers get a royal roasting. It's a hilarious collection that will appeal to everyone who both reviles and respects lawyers. Yes, it's true: Many lawyers let Wiley know how much they appreciate his attorney humor. It's a book made in legal heaven.

 id : 238860 ISBN : 0684860279  | name : It's what He Would've Wanted  |  description : Best known as a stand-up comedian and television star, Sean Hughes has won acclaim with his trademark black comedy. In It's What He Would've Wanted, Hughes combines edgy humor with considerable narrative powers to tell the story of Shea Hickson, whose footloose, disaffected existence is turned upside down when he finds his father, a BBC weatherman, hanging from the light fixture. The Hicksons appear to be a quintessentially comfortable, suburban, middle-class family. But when Shea discovers an encoded journal his Father had been keeping, he uncovers shocking revelations about his father's disappointed life as a parent, husband, and disillusioned minor celebrity. With wry humor and savage undercurrents the tale winds through the seamier side of London life -- skirting the worlds of television, newspapers, and small-scale urban terrorism. Ultimately, the unraveling of the Hickson family's increasingly distasteful secrets forces a reluctant Shea to grow up.
 id : 238866 ISBN : 0740726641  | name : FoxTrot, Assembled with Care  |  description : One of America's most treasured comic strips is releasing its eighth treasury, FoxTrot: Assembled with Care. And eight most assuredly will not be enough for fans of the funny pages.Bill Amend's FoxTrot debuted April 10, 1988, and 14 years later it's undisputedly among the most popular strips in newspapers. This colorful compilation of cartoons from FoxTrot's last two years again demonstrates that few entertainers in any medium are better at finding humor in everyday family life than Amend.At the core of much of the strip's wild humor is 10-year-old Jason. He tortures his parents and two teenage siblings Peter and Paige out of their minds with his computer and his pet iguana, Quincy. In this latest treasury, parents Roger and Andrea again have their hands full. In one strip, Jason boldly bursts into their bedroom in the middle of the night to announce that it's "2 A.M. and the lights still work." In another, Jason surprises his mom with a new beep for her computer known simply as "Defcon One." Jason also holds his own with his older siblings, spelling "My Sister Is Ugly" with the carved faces of 14 pumpkins.As FoxTrot surpasses the two million mark in book sales, it continues to demonstrate its timelessness with its always fresh, irreverent, and zany brand of family humor. Like other successful FoxTrot books before it, FoxTrot: Assembled with Care captures the humorous side of the trials and tribulations that come with daily family life like no other strip today.

"It's the very string," he said, "that my pearls are strung on!" The reason of his note to me had been that he really didn't want to give us a grain of succor -- our density was a thing too perfect in its way to touch. He had formed the habit of depending on it, and if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own. He comes back to me from that last occasion -- for I was never to speak to him again -- as a man with some safe preserve for sport. I wondered as I walked away where he had got _his_ tip.

 id : 238903 ISBN : 0801499224  | name : Racism and Justice  |  description : Affirmative action: does it really counteract racism? Is it morally justifiable? In her timely and tough-minded book, Gertrude Ezorsky addresses these central issues in the ongoing controversy surrounding affirmative action, and comes up with some convincing answers. Ezorsky begins by examining the effectiveness of affirmative action as a remedy for institutional racism in the workplace. She analyzes the ways in which common practices-selection of employees based on personal connections, qualification, and seniority standards-perpetuate the injurious effect of past racial discrimination, and she assesses the rationale for such affirmative action measures as objective job-related testing, numerical goals, and preferential treatment for basically qualified blacks. To illuminate the social reality in which affirmative action takes place, she draws on recent work by social scientists and legal scholars. Turning to the moral issues, Ezorsky posits two basic justifications for affirmative action: first, looking backward-to provide deserved compensation for past racial injustice that was sanctioned, practiced, and encouraged by our government; second, looking forward-to promote racial desegregation in the American workplace. Unlike some supporters of affirmative action, she does not deny that preferential treatment may place an unfair burden on white males. Indeed, she suggests specific practical measures for spreading that burden more equitably. Clear-headed, well-reasoned, and persuasive, this book will be read eagerly by everyone from students to legislators, by anyone concerned with racial justice in America.

 id : 238905 ISBN : 0880014407  | name : The Assignation  |  description : A woman's lover seems not to recognize her on the street. A teenage girl accepts a ride from a stranger in a rust-speckled Cadillac. An old man is obsessed by the memory of his innocent childhood intrusion on a half-dressed aunt. In forty-four very short, very powerful stories, Joyce Carol Oates fashions brief, intensely compact dramas out of the unwieldy material of human experience. The stories in The Assignation are infused with a "radiant intensity," wrote James Atlas in the New York Times Book Review, and they convey the depth and scope of a novel in a few charged pages. The Assignation is an electric display of the talents that make Joyce Carol Oates one of our finest short story writers.
 id : 238908 ISBN : 0415040116  | name : Experimental Design and Statistics  |  description : The distinguishing feature of experimental psychology is not so much the nature of its theories as the methods used to test their validity. The first edition of Experimental Design and Statistics provided a clear and lucid introduction to these methods and the statistical techniques which support them. For this new edition the text has been revised, the coverage of two-sample tests has been extended, and new sections have been added introducing one-sample tests, linear regression and the product-moment correlation coefficient. Problems associated with the applications of experimental design and how to use observations of behaviour in research are key questions for all introductory students of psychology.

 id : 238952 ISBN : 1853262234  | name : The Small House at Allington  |  description : Frankenstein is the classic gothic horror novel which has thrilled and engrossed readers for two centuries. Written by Mary Shelley, it is a story which she intended would curdle the blood and quicken the beatings of the heart. The tale is a superb blend of science fiction, mystery and thriller. Victor Frankenstein driven by the mad dream of creating his own creature, experiments with alchemy and science to build a monster stitched together from dead remains. Once the creature becomes a living breathing articulate entity, it turns on its maker and the novel darkens into tragedy. The reader is very quickly swept along by the force of the elegant prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multi-layered themes in the novel. Although first published in 1818, Shelleys masterpiece still maintains a strong grip on the imagination and has been the inspiration for numerous horror movies, television and stage adaptations.
 id : 238953 ISBN : 0460878204  | name : Christina Rossetti  |  description : This full-scale biography of Rossetti, reinstates her in her rightful place as a luminary among Victorian poets. Like Emily Dickinson, with whom she is often compared, Rossetti is a poet's poet who wrote some of the Victorian period's most lush, most original, and also some of its most restrained poetry. Because of the new appreciation for this highly accomplished work, and also because, through her brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Christina is so closely associated with the Pre-Raphaelites and their superb art and bohemian lives, there had been a resurgence of interest in this enigmatic writer. Here we learn of the deep sexual passions and ambivalence of her young adulthood; the men she chose and later denied; the warmth of her family life; her close ties to the grand literary figures of Victorian London; the religious devotion that suffused her later years; and her frustrated ambition to fulfill her life as an artist and a woman. Drawing on unread works and newly available letters, Marsh also makes sense for the first time of Rossetti's adolescent breakdown and recurrent depressions.
 id : 238957 ISBN : 0140437797  | name : A Sentimental Journey  |  description : Funny, human, highly learned and literary, sexy, and filled with psychological nuances that remain unrivaled at the hands of any other psychological writer. André Aciman A Penguin Classic A Sentimental Journey is a novel without a plot, a journey without a destination. It records the adventures of the amiable Parson Yorick, as he sets off on his travels through France and Italy, relishing his encounters with all manner of men and womenparticularly the pretty ones. Sterne's tale rapidly moves away from the narrative of travel to become a series of dramatic sketches, ironic incidents, philosophical musings, reminiscences, and anecdotes; sharp wit is mixed with gaiety, irony with tender feeling. With A Sentimental Journey, as well as his masterpiece, Tristram Shandy, Sterne forged a truly original style and established himself as the first of the stream-of-consciousness writers. This Penguin Classics edition features an introduction that discusses the novel in relation to Sterne's other writing and places it within the context of "sentimental" literature. Also included are a chronology, suggestions for further reading, and full explanatory notes. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.
 id : 238959 ISBN : 0385721994  | name : Wuhu Diary  |  description : In 1994 an American writer named Emily Prager met her new daughter LuLu. All she knew about her was that the baby had been born in Wuhu, a city in southern China, and left near a police station in her first three days of life. Her birth mother had left a note with Lulu's western and lunar birth dates. In 1999 Emily and her daughternow a happy, fearless four-year-old--returned to China to find out more. That journey and its discoveries unfold in this lovely, touching and sensitively observed book. In Wuhu Diary, we follow Emily and LuLu through a country where children are doted on yet often summarily abandoned and where immense human friendliness can coexist with outbursts of state-orchestrated hostilityparticularly after the U. S. accidentally bombs the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. We see Emily unearthing precious details of her childs past and LuLu coming to terms with who she is. The result is a book that will delight anyone interested in China, and that will move and instruct anyone who has ever adopted--or considered adopting--a child.

 id : 238966 ISBN : 0812991702  | name : Let Me Take You Down  |  description : A top crime journalist reveals precisely how the world-shattering murder of John Lennon happenedand why In Let Me Take You Down, Jack Jones penetrates the borderline world of dangerous fantasy in which Mark David Chapman stalked and killed Lennon: Mark David Chapman rose early on the morning of December 8 to make final preparations. . . . Chapman had neatly arranged and left behind a curious assortment of personal items on top of the hotel dresser. In an orderly semicircle, he had laid out his passport, an eight-track tape of the music of Todd Rundgren, his little Bible, open to The Gospel According to John (Lennon). He left a letter from a former YMCA supervisor at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where five years earlier, he had worked with refugees from the Vietnam War. Beside the letter were two photographs of himself surrounded by laughing Vietnamese children. At the center of the arrangement of personal effects, he had placed the small Wizard of Oz poster of Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion. I woke up knowing, somehow, that when I left that room, that was the last time I would see the room again, Chapman recalled. I truly felt it in my bones. I dont know how. I had never seen John Lennon up to that point. I only knew that he was in the Dakota. But I somehow knew that it was it, this was the day. So I laid out on the dresser at the hotel room . . . just a tableau of everything that was important in my life. So it would say, Look, this is me. Probably, this is the real me. This is my past and Im going, gone to another place. I practiced what it was going to look like when police officers came into the room. It was like I was going through a door and I knew I was going to go through a door, the poets door, William Blakes door, Jim Morrisons door. . . . I was leaving what I was, going into a future of uncertainty. Praise for Let Me Take You Down Jack Jones has written a beautiful book, rare in its attention to the social context giving rise to stalkers and assassins of celebrities . . . celebrity worship is ambivalentadmiration shares the altar with envy. When the worshipped disappoints, a nobody can become a somebody by killing the pop culture idol. Let Me Take You Down is both fascinating and brilliant.Ladd Wheeler, Professor of Psychology, University of Rochester, Former President of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology

 id : 238993 ISBN : 087923587X  | name : A B C Et Cetera  |  description : This is a book about the Roman alphabet and the people who used it as a medium for the transmission of their civilization. Primarily, this means the Romans and their Italic subjects, speakers of Latin who disseminated the language, and the culture of which it was an expression, throughout Europe and the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. As speakers, readers, and writers of English, we are greatly indebted to the long line of purveyors of Latin in its various forms. When words are borrowed, concepts come with them. So, if we have borrowed a wide variety of Latin words, it follows that we have also borrowed a great deal of the cultural stuff that they encase. This book takes a look at what the authors consider to be some of the more intriguing cultural/linguistic goodies that have crept willy-nilly into the English language over the ages from the Latin cornucopia. - Preamble.
 id : 238994 ISBN : 0299160343  | name : Wisconsin Folklore  |  description : Highly entertaining and richly informative, Wisconsin Folklore offers the first comprehensive collection of writings about the surprisingly varied folklore of Wisconsin. Beginning with a historical introduction to Wisconsin's folklore and concluding with an up-to-date bibliography, this anthology offers more than fifty annotated and illustrated entries in five sections: "Terms and Talk," "Storytelling," "Music, Song, and Dance," "Beliefs and Customs," and "Material Traditions and Folklife." The various contributors, from 1884 to 1997, are anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, historians, journalists, museologists, ordinary citizens reminiscing, sociologists, students, writers of fiction, practitioners of folklore, and folklorists. Their interests cover an enormous range of topics: from Woodland Indian place names and German dialect expressions to Welsh nicknames and the jargon of apple-pickers, brewers, and farmers; from Ho-Chunk and Ojibwa mythological tricksters and Paul Bunyan legends to stories of Polish strongmen and Ole and Lena jokes; from Menominee dances and Norwegian fiddling and polka music to African-American gospel groups and Hmong musicians; from faith healers and wedding and funeral customs to seasonal ethnic festivities and tavern amusements; and from spearing decoys and needlework to church dinners, sacred shrines, and the traditional work practices of commercial fishers, tobacco growers, and pickle packers. For general readers, teachers, librarians, and scholars alike, Wisconsin Folklore exemplifies and illuminates Wisconsin's cultural traditions, and establishes the state's significant but long neglected contributions to American folklore.

 id : 239062 ISBN : 0553107038  | name : Mama Rocks the Empty Cradle  |  description : Mama's back on the case, sniffing out dark, tragic secrets...and a killer. Not much happens in Otis, South Carolina (pop. 5,000) that Mama, a caseworker for the Department of Social Services, doesn't know about. Mama's given name is Grace Covington, but everyone calls her Candi--for the honeyed color of her complexion, not her cooking (which is second to none from Otis all the way to Atlanta, where I work as a paralegal). I usually go home when I need some truly soul-satisfying eating. But this time I was heading back to Otis to help Mama after her bunion operation. I had no idea we'd end up knee-deep in somebody else's trouble.... It all seemed to start when Mama and I were shopping for groceries and crazy old Miss Birdie stole Cricket Childs' tiny baby, causing a scene between the two women everyone in town heard about. It wasn't twenty-four hours later that Cricket, known as a lady who liked wild times and wilder men, turned up murdered in a fellow's bed. Even worse, Cricket's baby had vanished. To add to the chilling events, my Daddy's wandering dog Midnight dug up something shocking: an infant's skull. And not long after Mama rushed it over to Sheriff Abe's office, Midnight brought home another. Naturally, he couldn't tell us where he got them...and the mystery deepened. So no way Mama wasn't going to start snooping. And with the doctor ordering her off her feet, I ended up doing some legwork. But it's a good thing I still had two good feet, because before long, I was running for my life...as babies' cries and women's tears mingled in a crime fueled by motives as ancient as human memory--greed, jealousy, and old-fashioned revenge. In Mama Rocks the Empty Cradle, Nora DeLoach captures the warmth of family life in the deep South...and the icy tingling of superb suspense. And in Mama she has created a woman sleuth as filled with compassion as courage, wise in the ways of the human heart--and the criminal mind.

 id : 239137 ISBN : 0060198354  | name : The Torturer's Apprentice  |  description : This brilliant debut collection of stories by O. Henry Award winner John Biguenet is as notable for the rigor of its intellect as for the sweep of its imagination. Whether recounting the predicament of an atheistic stigmatic in "The Vulgar Soul" or a medieval torturer who must employ his terrible skills upon his own apprentice in the title tale, these stories decline to settle for ready sentiments or easy assurances. Rather than add to the massive canon of the victimized, for example, "My Slave" takes the perspective of the victimizer. In "The Open Curtain," a man achieves intimacy with his family only when he recognizes -- watching them dine as he sits in his car at the curb -- that he lives in a household of strangers. Menaced by a gang of skinheads in a Jewish cemetery, an American tourist in Germany placates the Neo-Nazis with a formula he continues to repeat even after he is safely back home in "I Am Not a Jew." And as for love, it makes demands in such stories as "Do Me" that shake our very notions of what it means to love. If these stories engage the world in sometimes shocking ways, they are virtuoso engagements, eloquent in their prose, surprising in their plotting, sly in their humor. Biguenet shifts among voices and narrative strategies and imposes neither a single style nor a repeated structure as he depicts the ecological catastrophe of "A Plague of Toads," the problem posed by a ghost in the nursery in "Fatherhood," and the ghastly discovery a grieving widower defends as "another kind of memory" in "Rose." Such mastery of craft may come as a surprise in a first-time author, but even more impressive is the object of his art. For whether it seeks to prick or to tickle, each story in The Torturer's Apprentice addresses its subject with an authority unusual in contemporary literature as it entices the reader beyond the boundaries of the expected and the accepted.

"I was one of them, dreaming of a perfect and healthy old age....Now, at fifty-eight, I realize the foolishness of my dreams as I watch my brain self-destruct from Alzheimer's."

By turns an autobiography, a medical history, and a book of meditations, Losing My Mind is a testament to the splendor of memory and a triumphant celebration of the human spirit.

 id : 239203 ISBN : 0060184906  | name : The Golems of Gotham  |  description : Many years have passed since Oliver Levin -- a bestselling mystery writer and a lifetime sufferer from blocked emotions -- has given any thought to his parents. Not to their double suicide inside a Miami synagogue, not to the horrors they endured in the Nazi concentration camps. He also hasnt thought much about his wife, who vanished inexplicably a decade earlier. Now, after years of uninterrupted literary output, Oliver Levin finds himself blocked as a writer, too. The only person aware of Oliver's anguish is his teenage daughter, Ariel, who lives with him on Edgar Allan Poe Street in Manhattan, longing for the grandparents she never knew and the mother she never had. An amateur kabbalist and suddenly a klezmer violin virtuoso, Ariel sets out to rescue her father from his demons and denial by summoning the people who she thinks hold the key to Oliver's emotional black hole -- his dead parents, Rose and Lothar. Inspired by the tale of the Golem of Prague, Ariel resurrects her grandparents as creatures of rescue, but they come back as ghosts with a plan of their own. Moreover, they don't come back alone; their entourage includes six famous writers -- all, including Primo Levi and Jerzy Kosinski, Holocaust survivors and suicide victims. Trekking through the surreal, millennial landscape, the Golems of Gotham transform Manhattan and take Ariel and Oliver on an achingly symbolic and hilarious journey that confronts the mysteries and the conflicted legacy left to the post-Holocaust world. Highly original and deeply insightful, The Golems of Gotham is a novel of moral philosophy that explores the relationship between art and atrocity, the artist's romance with madness, and his responsibility to history. Part ghost story, part mystery, it offers lasting commentary on the preservation and reinvention of memory, and the power of the mind to conjure both its own prison and liberation. On the surface a poignant story about a child's longing to save her father and a mystery writer's quest to decipher the riddle of his own life, The Golems of Gotham is a work of staggering imagination that explores some of the most haunting, unanswered questions of our time.

 id : 239223 ISBN : 0889841098  | name : Victims of Gravity  |  description : Dayv James-French is an elegant and fastidious writer of stories which disturb yet engage and delight us. Although this is his first book he is already a master of dialogue and silences and his writing compels us to listen carefully. Reviewing Dayv James-French's work to date in his Toronto Star column `New Voices,' Jason Sherman wrote: `The attraction is James-French's ability to perceive misery without succumbing to it. It is not just that there is humour in his work -- and there is a lot of humour -- it is that there is hope, as well.' The first story in Victims of Gravity begins: `There's an art to this.' The last ends: `whether or not a story has a happy ending.' In between Dayv James-French reveals a complex world, defined with wit and compassion, where a happy ending is less important than the rewards of the journey to it. `I never know what to say when I'm asked what a story is ``about''. What's life about? Any synopsis of the stories -- ``An overnight visit to a farm becomes an off-the-wall examination of two solitudes as a married woman tries to isolate the grounds of her emotional dissatisfaction while a gay man drugs himself past his own pain'' (``Cows'') -- sounds grim, as though I were leading the reader to an obvious conclusion; a neatly-tied up epiphany, if not a moral. Instead, I'm trying to convince readers of their own experience, its authenticity, and assure them that someone is paying attention.' `Even the ``Dave'' stories aren't entirely about me. An image, a remembered scrap of conversation, a personal emotional response I have to examine because of its inappropriateness; those are starting points. I obsess for weeks before I find my way into a story. More than a few times I've had to abandon a story after ten or twelve pages because I couldn't love the characters enough. At the same time, I don't -- can't -- make them fit into my obsessions. All of these stories remained unfinished until the characters surprised me.' Dayv James-French has a sharp little eye focused on the telling details of modern life, and an excellent ear for the nuances of conversation and silence. In his stories, the most mundane situations become illuminating; they are heightened to the level of objective correlatives. Dialogue becomes a kind of poetry of the banal. His characters are often unable to hear what is spoken to them, listening as they are to the voices of their own histories. What seems random and coincidental is carefully fitted into biographies of striking psychological accuracy. For all the very real horrors of loss and betrayal suffered by the characters, the stories shine with a hopeful optimism that might be called wisdom. `Life is randomly cruel and unforgiving. But we are at our most hilarious when we are passionately involved in pretending it isn't. Luckily for us, the peak of emotional intensity is followed by a moment of silence and, in that moment, we can choose to be dignified instead of ridiculous. In my fiction, I try to work towards that moment. Every so often I discover that being ridiculous is the better choice. At least, it can be the more honest choice.'

Packed with 1,000 recipes that are seductive, sexy, and utterly delicious, Passionate Vegetarian covers all the bases of meatless cooking, from east (Stir Fry of Asparagus with Black Bean-Ginger Sauce), west (Talk of the Town Barbecued Tofu), from the Mediterranean (Swiss Chard with Raisins, Onions & Olives) to the American South (Black-Eyed Pea Ragovt). You'll find lush lasagnas; plump pierogies; bountiful burgers, beans, and breads; pleasing pasta and pies. You'll spoon up soups and stews, and delight in desserts from simple to swoonworthy. Written by longtime vegetarian Crescent Dragonwagon, author of Dairy Hollow House Soup & Bread Cookbook, Passionate Vegetarian employs innovative methods (try "Ri-sort-ofs," in which risotto technique is used to create splendid, richly flavored grain dishes built around not just rice but also barley, buckwheat, spelt, and even toasted oats with an array of seasonings) and introduces lesser-known ingredients (get to know and love not just tofu and tempeh but a whole new generation of soyfoods, as well as "Quick Fixes" like instant bean flakes).

 id : 239411 ISBN : 0066210658  | name : Gaudi  |  description : At the time of his death in 1926, Antonio Gaudi was arguably the most famous architect in the world. He had created some of the greatest and most controversial masterpieces of modern architecture, which were as exotic as they were outrageous. For many, Gaudi's unique architecture is Barcelona. But little is known about the shadowy figure behind the swirling, vivid buildings that inspired the surrealists. A fervent Catholic with an unstinting love for Catalonia, his homeland, an innovator who was profoundly orthodox, and a hermit who chose lifelong celibacy, having been rejected by the woman he loved, Gaudi was both brilliant and eccentric. He was very much the product of his time and place, and this masterful biography brings both man and architect powerfully to life against the changing backdrop of Barcelona and Catalonia. Gijs van Hensbergen leads us through the design and construction of Gaudi's most significant buildings, revealing their innovation and complexity and demonstrating the growing relevance of Gaudi's architecture today. The author captures not only the power and importance of Gaudi's work but the unique spirit of Catalan culture as well. This supreme artist lived by extravagant gestures and a creativity that bordered on madness. Even his legendary death under a tram as he stepped back to admire his cathedral in Barcelona has the hint of absurdity and poetry. In this first critical biography of one of Spain's most celebrated artists and the twentieth century's greatest architect, Gijs van Hensbergen makes a compelling argument for Gaudi's stature as icon of artistic integrity and genius.

Living in hastily built shacks just yards from the Atlantic Ocean, the men were completely unprepared for the 200-mile-per-hour winds and massive waves that would assail them on the night of September 2, 1935. In "Storm of the Century, journalist Willie Drye creates a vivid account of the storm' s rampage. DryeStorm of the Century is a haunting tale of the devastating power of nature and politics. Praise for "Storm of the Century: " Engrossing....Vividly captures the hurricane' s monstrous energy."

A Sophis, une ville située non loin de leur université dans l'Etat de New York, McMann et Zimmern rencontrent une bande de fanatiques versés dans le spiritualisme : " Les Chercheurs de Vérité ". Brillante satire de la sociologie et du monde totalitaire des sectes, l'auteur multiplie les leurres et les surprises avec cet humour de détective apte à débusquer les impostures des systèmes de vérité.
 id : 239430 ISBN : 2070427641  | name : On n'y voit rien  |  description : Que fait-on quand on regarde une peinture ? A quoi pense-t-on ? Qu'imagine-t-on ? Comment dire, comment se dire à soi-même ce que l'on voit ou devine ? Et comment l'historien d'art peut-il interpréter sérieusement ce qu'il voit un peu, beaucoup, passionnément ou pas du tout ? En six courtes fictions narratives qui se présentent comme autant d'enquêtes sur des évidences du visible, de Velázquez à Titien, de Bruegel à Tintoret, Daniel Arasse propose des aventures du regard. Un seul point commun entre les tableaux envisagés : la peinture y révèle sa puissance en nous éblouissant, en démontrant que nous ne voyons rien de ce qu'elle nous montre. On n'y voit rien ! Mais ce rien, ce n'est pas rien. Écrit par un des historiens d'art les plus brillants d'aujourd'hui, ce livre adopte un ton vif, libre et drôle pour aborder le savoir sans fin que la peinture nous délivre à travers les siècles.

 id : 239439 ISBN : 2228897337  | name : En observant Venise  |  description : Il est inutile de prétendre que la Venise touristique n'est pas la véritable Venise, ce qui demeure possible pour d'autres villes - Rome, Florence ou Naples. La Venise des touristes est Venise : les gondoliers, les couchers de soleil, la lumière changeante, le Florian, le Quadri, Torcello, le Harry's Bar, Murano, Burano, les pigeons, les ouvrages de perles, le vaporetto. Venise est un accordéon de cartes postales d'elle-même. De ce point de vue, le livre de Mary McCarthy (1912-1989) est irremplaçable car il est nourri d'une passion lucide. Le goût du croquis s'y associe à une culture raffinée. Au fil de ses bonheurs comme de ses humeurs, jonglant avec tous les arts, l'écrivain nous offre sans doute l'un des plus beaux essais sur Venise. Mary McCarthy est l'auteur, dans la même collection, d'un autre portrait de ville : "Les Pierres de Florence".

Bons voisins et amis de longue date, ils se prennent un jour de querelle pour une raison futile. La dispute prend vite les proportions d'une épopée, dont s'émeuvent tous les habitants... Au-delà de l'évocation truculente de la vie provinciale, qui annonce Le Revizor et Les Ames mortes, ce récit, qui fit l'enchantement de Pouchkine, valut à Gogol sa réputation de " poète de la vie réelle ".

Et je le plains encore ? Et pour comble d'ennui Mon cur, mon lâche cur s'intéresse pour lui ? Je tremble, au seul penser du coup qui le menace ? Et prête à me venger je lui fais déjà grâce ?

Il se leva et, saisissant sa femme par un bras, il lui demanda qui était dans ce cas, l'homme qu'elle avait caché dans la garde-robe. Gilda répéta la phrase avec stupéfaction et fit un geste, comme pour dire que son mari était fou. Elle ajouta, de mauvaise grâce, qu'il fallait la laisser. Ces mots, elle les prononça avec dégoût. Avant même de pouvoir se rendre compte de ce qui lui arrivait, elle se retrouva allongée sur le lit, avec Sangiorgio sur elle, haletant, lui serrant le cou.

Observateur exceptionnel, il croise des potentats comme Nkrumah, Kenyatta ou Idi Amin, témoigne de coups d'Etat et de guerres civiles (au Rwanda par exemple) ; il essuie des fusillades, affronte des tempêtes de sable et supporte l'indescriptible chaleur africaine. Mais Kapuscinski s'intéresse surtout aux gens et sait gagner leur confiance. Le tumulte de la vie quotidienne africaine le passionne davantage que les corruptions, les épidémies et les guerres meurtrières. Ce livre majeur, attendu depuis longtemps, a reçu en 2000 le prestigieux prix littéraire italien Viareggio."

 id : 239473 ISBN : 0226764214  | name : The Science of Energy  |  description : Although we take it for granted today, the concept of "energy" transformed nineteenth-century physics. In The Science of Energy, Crosbie Smith shows how a North British group of scientists and engineers, including James Joule, James Clerk Maxwell, William and James Thomson, Fleeming Jenkin, and P. G. Tait, developed energy physics to solve practical problems encountered by Scottish shipbuilders and marine engineers; to counter biblical revivalism and evolutionary materialism; and to rapidly enhance their own scientific credibility. Replacing the language and concepts of classical mechanics with terms such as "actual" and "potential" energy, the North British group conducted their revolution in physics so astutely and vigorously that the concept of "energy"a valuable commodity in the early days of industrializationbecame their intellectual property. Smith skillfully places this revolution in its scientific and cultural context, exploring the actual creation of scientific knowledge during one of the most significant episodes in the history of physics.

 id : 239494 ISBN : 0060564164  | name : The Dive  |  description : The sea was our common home, and I felt our connection went back a very long way -- to a time that predated man's emergence from the water. In 1996, Francisco "Pipín" Ferreras, a native Cuban and a world champion in the dangerous and controversial sport of free diving, met Audrey Mestre, a beautiful French marine biology student who had sought him out in Cabo San Lucas for her research. A passionate romance immediately bloomed between the two, and their love was bonded by a shared fascination with and devotion to the ocean. When the couple moved back to Miami, Audrey took up the sport herself and quickly proceeded to break the female world record (115 meters). They soon became free diving's power couple, testing the limits of their wills and bodies by descending to unthinkable depths, training and touring together, encouraging and motivating each other. Then, on October 12, 2002, in a dive off the coast of the Dominican Republic, tragedy struck: Audrey's attempt to break the world record with a dive of 170 meters ended in her death. Suddenly, Pipín -- haunted by questions, reeling from the loss of his soul mate -- could no longer find solace in the sea that had always been his true home. Now, for the first time, Pipín tells his story. He shares the heart-pounding adventure and fierce competition that fuel the sport of free diving and his own addiction to it. He addresses the controversy that has followed him throughout his career and that spun out of control after Audrey's death. And he relates the haunting story of his relationship with Audrey -- a unique and complicated tale of love and obsession taken to extreme depths.

 id : 239509 ISBN : 0813315158  | name : Ain't No Makin' It  |  description : I ain't goin' to college. Who wants to go to college? I'd just end up gettin' a shitty job anyway. So said Freddie Piniella, an eleven-year-old boy from Clarendon Heights low-income housing project, to Jay MacLeod, his counselor in a youth program. MacLeod was struck by the seeming self-defeatism of Freddie and his friends. How is it that in America, a nation of dreams and opportunities, a boy of eleven can feel trapped in a position of inherited poverty?The author immersed himself in the teenage underworld of Clarendon Heights. The Hallway Hangers, one of the neighborhood cliques, appear as cynical self-destructive hoodlums. The other group, the Brothers, take the American Dream to heart and aspire to middle-class respectability. The twist is that the Hallway Hangers are mostly white; the Brothers are almost all black. Comparing the two groups, MacLeod provides a provocative account of how poverty is perpetuated from one generation to the next.Part One tells the story of the boys' teenage aspirations. Part Two follows the Hallway Hangers and the Brothers into adulthood. Eight years later the author returns to Clarendon Heights to find the members of both gangs struggling in the labor market or on the streets. Caught in the web of urban industrial decline, the Hallway Hangersundereducated, unemployed, or imprisonedhave turned to the underground economy. But cocaine capitalism only fuels their desperation, and the Hallway Hangers seek solace in sexism and racism. The ambitious Brothers have fared little better. Their teenage dreams in tatters, the Brothers demonstrate that racism takes its toll on optimistic aspirations.This edition retains the vivid accounts of friendships, families, school, and work that made the first edition so popular. The ethnography resonates with feeling and vivid dialogue. But the book also addresses one of the most important issues in modern social theory and policy: how social inequality is reproduced from one generation to the next. MacLeod links individual lives with social theory to forge a powerful argument about how inequality is created, sustained, and accepted in the United States.

 id : 239666 ISBN : 0891418091  | name : Ripcord  |  description : On April 10, 1970, Hill 927 was occupied by troopers of the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division. By July, the activities of the artillery and infantry of Ripcord had caught the attention of the NVA (North Vietnamese Army) and a long and deadly siege ensued. Ripcord was the Screaming Eagles last chance to do significant damage to the NVA in the A Shau Valley before the division was withdrawn from Vietnam and returned to the United States. At Ripcord, the enemy counterattacked with ferocity, using mortar and antiaircraft fire to inflict heavy causalities on the units operating there. The battle lasted four and a half months and exemplified the ultimate frustration of the Vietnam War: the inability of the American military to bring to bear its enormous resources to win on the battlefield. In the end, the 101st evacuated Ripcord, leaving the NVA in control of the battlefield. Contrary to the mantra We won every battle but lost the war, the United States was defeated at Ripcord. Now, at last, the full story of this terrible battle can be told.

 id : 239684 ISBN : 0609609343  | name : In the Absence of Sun  |  description : A breathtaking true story of a rescue mission undertaken by a young woman and her family in one of the most repressive countries in the world. Helie Lee often had heard her grandmother speak of an uncle, lost decades ago when he was a child during the familys daring escape from North Korea. As an adult, he was still living there under horrid conditions. When her grandmother began to ail, Helie became determined to reunite her with her eldest son, despite tremendous odds. Helies mission became even more urgent when she realized that her first book, the bestselling novel Still Life with Rice, about the familys escape, might have angered the North Korean government and put her uncle in danger. Pushing through rivers and forests, fighting the cold, bribing and manipulating border guards, gangsters, and secret service agents, Helie and her father finally achieve their goal. But there are many hurdles. Her uncle is forced to make a harrowing choice: leave his North Korean family behind or continue to live in oppression and starvation away from his beloved mother. And Helie has to face her deep, sometimes ambivalent, emotions about her identity in the family and as a Korean American woman. Unmarried and outspoken, she struggles in Korea, where women marry early and keep silent, and writes eloquently about the landscape there, both literal and cultural. She comes through a heartbreaking love affair only to face an intense and confusing relationship with the Guidethe man who, despite being crude and macho, ultimately helps to save her uncle and eventually his extended family through several daring acts of heroism. In the Absence of Sun is a riveting adventure story and a powerful tale of family bonds and reunion. An eerie fear crawled through my flesh as I stood on the Chinese side of the Yalu River, gazing across the murky water into one of the most closed-off and isolated countries in the world. I couldnt believe it. Even as my boots sank into the doughy mud, I had trouble coming to terms with the fact that I was actually standing there. . . . I was not prepared for the kind of despair and insane fear I felt that day. My wizened old uncle looked nothing like the sweet-faced teenager in the faded photograph that Halmoni kept pressed between the pages of her Bible. That day, at the Yalu River, staring helplessly into his terrorized face, I hadnt fully realized what a dangerous thing I had done the year before. I had placed him and his family in danger. By including details of my uncles life in a book, I had alerted North Koreas enigmatic leadership to the identity of my relatives in a nation where it was better to remain invisible. From In the Absence of Sun

 id : 239715 ISBN : 0771033419  | name : Canada  |  description : The top non-fiction bestseller of fall 2000 was the authoritative and beautiful Canada: A Peoples History, Volume One. For fall 2001, M&S is proud to present the equally stunning and comprehensive second volume of this landmark work. This fall, on consecutive Sunday evenings starting on September 30, the CBC will broadcast eight new episodes from its spectacular  and spectacularly successful  series Canada: A Peoples History. Volume Two opens with the rebellion over property and language rights for the French-speaking Métis in Manitoba, led by the charismatic and troubled Louis Riel  a key event in our history and one that haunts us to this day. It closes with the less bloody but no less traumatic confrontation between the Mohawk and the army at Oka, Quebec, in 1990. Between these two harrowing events lie more than a hundred years of astonishing change and development in Canada. In those years Canadians have fought in two world wars, struggled through long, savage Depression years, adjusted to the post-war world, and peaceably accommodated themselves to wave after wave of immigrants arriving from around the globe. The political changes have been no less striking, with the eruption of nationalism in Quebec, womens long fight for equal rights, and the creation of Canadians most cherished social service: universal health care. Even more than was possible in Volume One, this well-researched book tells the major events of the twentieth century as a story of people: the famous and occasionally flamboyant politicians and public figures are here, but the books strength lies in the stories of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The tremendous popularity and the impeccable historical accuracy of both the first year of the television series and the first volume of the book, surprised and delighted historians and reviewers alike. The second year of the series and the second volume of the book are both now poised to rocket to even greater success in 2001.

 id : 239727 ISBN : 0826210945  | name : German Settlement in Missouri  |  description : German immigrants came to America for two main reasons: to seek opportunities in the New World, and to avoid political and economic problems in Europe. In German Settlement in Missouri, Robyn Burnett and Ken Luebbering demonstrate the crucial role that the German immigrants and their descendants played in the settlement and development of Missouri's architectural, political, religious, economic, and social landscape. Relying heavily on unpublished memoirs, letters, diaries, and official records, the authors provide important new narratives and firsthand commentary from the immigrants themselves. Between 1800 and 1919, more than 7 million people came to the United States from German-speaking lands. The German immigrants established towns as they moved up the Missouri River into the frontier, resuming their traditional ways as they settled. As a result, the culture of the frontier changed dramatically. The Germans farmed differently from their American neighbors. They started vineyards and wineries, published German-language newspapers, and entered Missouri politics. The decades following the Civil War brought the golden age of German culture in the state. The populations of many small towns were entirely German, and traditions from the homeland thrived. German-language schools, publications, and church services were common. As the German businesses in St. Louis and other towns flourished, the immigrants and their descendants prospered. The loyalty of the Missouri Germans was tested in World War I, and the anti-immigrant sentiment during the war and the period of prohibition after it dealt serious blows to their culture. However, German traditions had already found their way into mainstream American life. Informative and clearly written, German Settlement in Missouri will be of interest to all readers, especially those interested in ethnic history.

 id : 239732 ISBN : 0385483821  | name : Only the Paranoid Survive  |  description : Andy Grove, founder and former CEO of Intel shares his strategy for success as he takes the reader deep inside the workings of a major company in Only the Paranoid Survive. Under Andy Grove's leadership, Intel became the world's largest chip maker and one of the most admired companies in the world. In Only the Paranoid Survive, Grove reveals his strategy for measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads--when massive change occurs and a company must, virtually overnight, adapt or fall by the wayside--in a new way. Grove calls such a moment a Strategic Inflection Point, which can be set off by almost anything: mega-competition, a change in regulations, or a seemingly modest change in technology. When a Strategic Inflection Point hits, the ordinary rules of business go out the window. Yet, managed right, a Strategic Inflection Point can be an opportunity to win in the marketplace and emerge stronger than ever. Grove underscores his message by examining his own record of success and failure, including how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which threatened Intel's reputation in 1994, and how he has dealt with the explosions in growth of the Internet. The work of a lifetime, Only the Paranoid Survive is a classic of managerial and leadership skills.

 id : 239757 ISBN : 0688154948  | name : Gary Cooper  |  description : The first definitive biography of Gary Cooper, national icon of the American Dream, from one of our most distinguished biographers. In classic films such as "High Noon," Gary Cooper came to symbolize American ideals of self-reliance, independence, and integrity, but his turbulent private life was often at odds with his squeaky-clean public persona. The off-screen Cooper was anything but simple -- behind Gary Cooper's American Dream facade lay a tempestuous life. As this meticulously researched book tracks his film career in fascinating detail, it tells the parallel tale of his complicated relationships with Marlene Dietrich and Patricia Neal (to name only two of many), his involvement with the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Hollywood black-list, and his long friendship with Ernest Hemingway. With the full cooperation of the actor's daughter as well as such colleagues and close friends as Arlene Dahl and Fay Wray, Meyers examines every aspect of Cooper's life, beginning with his youth in Montana where he was a real cowboy before making the leap to Hollywood. There he created some of the quintessential screen westerns in movie history -- awkward, honest men who captured America's imagination with an irresistible air of aw-shucks simplicity. Gary Cooper is a robust portrait of a great star whose contradictions only enhance the artistry with which he created some of the most unforgettable and enduring characters of Hollywood's Golden Age.

 id : 239793 ISBN : 0674769783  | name : Righteous Discontent  |  description : What Du Bois noted has gone largely unstudied until now. In this book, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham gives us our first full account of the crucial role of black women in making the church a powerful institution for social and political change in the black community. Between 1880 and 1920, the black church served as the most effective vehicle by which men and women alike, pushed down by racism and poverty, regrouped and rallied against emotional and physical defeat. Focusing on the National Baptist Convention, the largest religious movement among black Americans, Higginbotham shows us how women were largely responsible for making the church a force for self-help in the black community. In her account, we see how the efforts of women enabled the church to build schools, provide food and clothing to the poor, and offer a host of social welfare services. And we observe the challenges of black women to patriarchal theology. Class, race, and gender dynamics continually interact in Higginbotham's nuanced history. She depicts the cooperation, tension, and negotiation that characterized the relationship between men and women church leaders as well as the interaction of southern black and northern white women's groups. Higginbotham's history is at once tough-minded and engaging. It portrays the lives of individuals within this movement as lucidly as it delineates feminist thinking and racial politics. She addresses the role of black Baptist women in contesting racism and sexism through a "politics of respectability" and in demanding civil rights, voting rights, equal employment, and educational opportunities. Righteous Discontent finally assigns women their rightful place in the story of political and social activism in the black church. It is central to an understanding of African American social and cultural life and a critical chapter in the history of religion in America.

 id : 239832 ISBN : 0679755101  | name : Out of Order  |  description : Why are our politicians almost universally perceived as liars? What made candidate Bill Clinton's draft record more newsworthy than his policy statements? How did George Bush's masculinity, Ronald Reagan's theatrics with a microphone, and Walter Mondale's appropriation of a Wendy's hamburger ad make or break their presidential campaigns? Ever since Watergate, says Thomas E. Patterson, the road to the presidency has led through the newsrooms, which in turn impose their own values on American politics. The results are campaigns that resemble inquisitions or contests in which the candidates' game plans are considered more important than their goals. Lucid and aphoristic, historically informed and as timely as a satellite feed, Out of Order mounts a devastating inquest into the press's hijacking of the campaign process -- and shows what citizens and legislators can do to win it back.

 id : 239835 ISBN : 0140432086  | name : The Wealth of Nations  |  description : The classic economic treatise that insipired Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century The publication of The Wealth of Nations in 1776 coincided with America's Declaration of Independence, and with this landmark treatise on political economy, Adam Smith paved the way for modern capitalism, arguing that a truly free market - fired by competition yet guided as if by an 'invisible hand' to ensure justice and equality - was the engine of a fair and productive society. Books I - III of The Wealth of Nations examine the 'division of labour' as the key to economic growth, by ensuring the interdependence of individuals within society. They also cover the origins of money and the importance of wages, profit, rent and stocks, but the real sophistication of his analysis derives from the fact that it encompasses a combination of ethics, philosophy and history to create a vast panorama of society. This edition contains an analytical introduction offering an in-depth discussion of Smith as an economist and social scientist, as well as a preface, further reading and explanatory notes by Andrew Skinner.

There were eight attempts to assassinate Queen Victoria during her long reign; four of them were of Irish origin. The most serious of all was the 'Jubilee Plot', a conspiracy apparently hatched in New York by the Fenian Brotherhood to blow up the Queen, her family and most of the British Cabinet with dynamite at the great service of thanksgiving to commemorate the 50th anniversary of her accession, held at Westminster Abbey in June 1887. The plot was 'uncovered' by Scotland Yard with just a few days to go. Several of the bombers were caught, tried and sentenced to penal servitude for life. But - warned off in time - the master bomber escaped to America... Now, using recently declassified Foreign Office Secret files (marked 'Fenian Brotherhood'), the author discloses for the first time the huge secret at the heart of the British counter-intelligence operation against militant Irish nationalists: the entire conspiracy was masterminded for its own reasons by a clandestine British agency reporting directly to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury.

 id : 239857 ISBN : 0060096578  | name : Sacred Wounds  |  description : In this immensely affecting and empowering guide, Jan Goldstein teaches readers how to take their most emotionally painful life events -- their spiritual wounds -- and transform them into a source of power and well-being. Goldstein's life-affirming program is inspired by his own heartbreak: the February morning when he was faced with the sudden news that his twelve-year marriage was ending, leaving Goldstein with primary custody of their three small children. Though paralyzed at first by feelings of loss and depression, Goldstein eventually discovered that the pain allowed him and his children a deeper appreciation for the simple moments of joy -- that his once "broken" family was succeeding not despite its wounds, but because of them. In Sacred Wounds, Goldstein reveals the secret to finding strength in challenging and often traumatic events, outlining a life-changing nine-step process to help readers move through heartache and toward healing. In clear, compassionate language, he refutes the notion of pain as a destroyer, drawing on the compelling stories of many of the people he has counseled along the way: Rick and Sara, who are plagued by infertility; Yvette, an aspiring man who battles her secular desires; Steve, for whom a frightening diagnosis portends the end...and then the beginning of hope. Remarkably affecting and inspiring, Goldstein's stories confirm that we are all well equipped to deal with the inevitable hurts and heartbreaks in life -- if only we release our preconceptions, acknowledge the strengthening power of our wounds, and follow the nine steps to a spiritual rebirth. Indispensable for anyone suffering through spiritual and emotional difficulties, Sacred Wounds is the key to shifting our perceptions and finding new strength and success in the painful experiences we all endure.
 id : 239858 ISBN : 0805060685  | name : Cries Unheard  |  description : England's controversial #1 best-seller. What brings a child to kill another child? In 1968, at age eleven, Mary Bell was tried and convicted of murdering two small boys in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Gitta Sereny, who covered the sensational trial, never believed the characterization of Bell as the incarnation of evil, the bad seed personified. If we are ever to understand the pressures that lead children to commit serious crimes, Sereny felt, only those children, as adults, can enlighten us. Twenty-seven years after her conviction, Mary Bell agreed to talk to Sereny about her harrowing childhood, her terrible acts, her public trial, and her years of imprisonment-to talk about what was done to her and what she did, who she was and who she became. Nothing Bell says is intended as an excuse for her crimes. But her devastating story forces us to ponder society's responsibility for children at the breaking point, whether in Newcastle, Arkansas, or Oregon.

 id : 239863 ISBN : 019283617X  | name : On the Genealogy of Morals  |  description : On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) is a book about the history of ethics and about interpretation. Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the 4entral values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns. This edition places his ideas within the cultural context of his own time and stresses the relevance of his work for a contemporary audience. - ;`Reason, seriousness, mastery over the emotions, the whole murky affair which goes by the name of thought, all the privileges and showpieces of man: what a high price has been paid for them!

 id : 239864 ISBN : 0066213967  | name : Death in Slow Motion  |  description : Azheimer's is death in slow motion," says Eleanor Cooney in this jarring and unsentimental memoir about caring for her mother, "and it has the ability to kill love while the person you love still breathes." When it was all but certain that her once-glamorous and witty novelist-mother had Alzheimer's, Cooney moved her from her beloved Connecticut home to California in order to care for her. In tense, searing prose, punctuated with the blackest of humor, Cooney documents the slow erosion of her mother's mind, of the powerful bond the two shared, and her own descent into drink and despair. "She was always my favorite person," says Eleanor, "hip, cool, brilliant, funny, sane -- my ultimate confidante and sympathizer." Now, overwhelmed by the Chinese water torture of endless small worries, endlessly repeated, that dementia thrusts on victim and caregiver, Cooney resorts to booze, tranquilizers, and gallows wit to blunt the edges of the relentless loss and the demands of ministering to this devastating disease. But the coping mechanism that finally serves this eloquent writer best is writing, the ability to bring to vivid life the memories her mother is losing. As her mother gropes in the gathering darkness for a grip on the world she once loved, succeeding only in conjuring sad fantasies of places and times with her dead husband, Cooney revisits their true past. Death in Slow Motion becomes the mesmerizing story of Eleanor's actual childhood, straight out of the pages of John Cheever; the daring and vibrant mother she remembers; and a time that no longer exists for either of them. Deeply moving, shockingly honest, and framed by wounded love, Cooney's tale reveals in remorseless prose the true nature of the beast called Alzheimer's, and with it, the arcane processes of the writer's craft and of a splendid mind's disintegration. "Alzheimer's," Cooney writes, "you'll never be the same once it's paid you a visit."

 id : 239867 ISBN : 074320025X  | name : Fly-Fishing for Sharks  |  description : For three years, journalist Richard Louv listened to America by going fishing with Americans. Doing what many of us dream of, he traveled from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from trout waters east and west to bass waters north and south. Fly-Fishing for Sharks is the result of his journey, a portrait of America on the water, fishing rod in hand. To explore the cultures of fishing, Louv joined a bass tournament on Lake Erie and got a casting lesson from fly-fishing legend Joan Wulff He angled with corporate executives in Montana and fly-fished for sharks in California. He spent time with fishing-boat captains in Florida, the regulars who fish New York City's Hudson River, and a river witch in Colorado. He teamed secrets of fishing and living from steelheaders in the Northwest, Bass'n Gals in Texas, and an ice-fisher in the North Woods. Along the way, he heard from one of Hemingway's sons what it was like to fish with Papa and from Robert Kennedy, Jr., how fishing changed his fife. As he describes the eccentricities, obsessions, and tribulations of dedicated anglers, he also uncovers the values that unite them. He reveals the healing qualities of fishing, how it binds the generations, how the angling business has grown, and how the future of fishing is threatened. But most of all, Fly-Fishing for Sharks is about the unforgettable characters Louv meets on the water and the stories they tell. From them, Louv learns about our changing relationship with nature, about a hidden America -- and about himself.

 id : 239890 ISBN : 0312205171  | name : Courage  |  description : Courage is not the absence of fear, says Osho. It is, rather, the total presence of fear, with the courage to face it. This book provides a bird's-eye view of the whole terrain-where fears originate, how to understand them, and how to find the courage to face them. In the process, Osho proposes that whenever we are faced with uncertainty and change in our lives, it is actually a cause for celebration. Instead of trying to hang on to the familiar and the known, we can learn to enjoy these situations as opportunities for adventure and for deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. The book begins with an in-depth exploration of the meaning of courage and how it is expressed in the everyday life of the individual. Unlike books that focus on heroic acts of courage in exceptional circumstances, the focus here is on developing the inner courage that enables us to lead authentic and fulfilling lives on a day-to-day basis. This is the courage to change when change is needed, the courage to stand up for our own truth, even against the opinions of others, and the courage to embrace the unknown in spite of our fears-in our relationships, in our careers, or in the ongoing journey of understanding who we are and why we are here. Courage also features a number of meditation techniques specifically designed by Osho to help people deal with their fears.

 id : 239943 ISBN : 096781622X  | name : Ong's Hat  |  description : Has the great world-mind of the telecommunication infrastructure begun to breed its own myths? The elusiveness of the Incunabula's original proponents, Emory Cranston (a pseudonym) and Joseph Matheny (his real name), has spawned wild speculation that the Ong's Hat legend is nothing but a media hoax. However there is a dark side to this story that has never been fully told, which may help explain their circumspection. What began as an heretical Islamic sect founded in the early 1900s by Black circus magician, Noble Drew Ali, evolved over the century into a techno-tantric commune whose members managed to escape this befouled world into a pristine, Edenic parallel universe, a New Jersey Pine Barrens devoid of inhabitants. This latter rag-tag group built the 'Egg' -- a glistening Faberge-like device that enabled trans-dimensional travel into unpopulated mirror worlds (per the Everett-Wheeler-Graham model). A special quantum-tantric feature allowed passage for two occupants while they made love, irrespective of their race, age or gender. But wait, there's more! Add to this mix a benevolent race of humanoids descended from Javanese lemurs on a parallel Earth, capable of dimensional shift without machinery, who have been world tripping for thousands of years. You've got your chaos; sex magick; applied quantum physics; shadow conspiracy; crypto-palaeontology and enlightenment hopes all wrapped up in one neat package. What the Hell more do you want?
 id : 239944 ISBN : 0688155014  | name : The First Partner--hillary Rodham Clinton  |  description : In 1998, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the most admired woman in America while also becoming the most visibly wronged wife in the world. Standing by her husband, President Bill Clinton, as she and the nation learned the truth behind the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the First Lady assumed two roles--dutiful spouse and passionate defense attorney--which she had played on numerous occasions during the course of their tumultuous yet politically unified relationship. Now esteemed biographer and journalist Joyce Milton examines this formidable, fascinating woman, giving probing insight into the First Lady's character, her values and her career. In The First Partner, Milton goes behind the scenes at the Clinton White House and explores the First Lady's involvement in Travelgate, Filegate, the Health Care Task Force fiasco and fund-raising for the 1996 presidential campaign, showing how these controversies grew out of the tensions in her political partnership with Bill Clinton. Milton also describes how Mrs. Clinton's defensive reactions to her husband's chronic infidelities have often misfired and have sometimes enabled his bad behavior. She examines the differing psychologies of the President and First Lady, yet shows that when faced with political accusations, they take a similar approach of telling only as much of the truth as is necessary--a reaction that has increasingly gotten them into trouble. Meticulously reported and researched, The First Partner offers keen new understanding of this complex woman who has infuriated and confounded as many people as she has inspired.

And you love to hear it. But is inciting pleasure a legitimate medical prescription for boosting a person's immunity? Can you literally fight off infection with a smile? Researchers Carl Charnetski and Francis Brennan say yes, and in Feeling Good Is Good for You they present a convincing amount of evidence to support this comforting claim. Drawing on the results from hundreds of studies, including their own extensively publicized findings, the authors explain the science behind the connection between pleasure and the immune system, and suggest fun ways to receive its full benefits. Feeling Good is Good for You addresses one of the most fundamental questions in medicine: How can we better teach our bodies to protect us from disease? A virtual explosion of information has emerged in recent years about the wide range of factors that can influence health. But some of the most promising research focuses on the role the mind plays in influencing the body. As this book reveals, the power that positive thought, joy, and emotional well-being have over the body's immune system is not only measurable but influential. Pleasure not only feels good, it does good things to our bodies. It promotes good health and helps protect us against disease. Anyone can boost their immunity by accepting the Immunity-Pleasure Connection. When the payoff is pure pleasure, what's not to like?

 id : 239962 ISBN : 1571741631  | name : Neale Donald Walsch on Relationships  |  description : We are all involved in relationships. Indeed, we are all in relationship with everything and everyone, all of the time. We have a relationship with ourselves, with our family, with our environment, with our work, with each other. Everything that we know and experience about ourselves, we understand within the context created by our relationships. For this reason, relationships are sacred--all relationships. And somewhere within the deepest reaches of our heart and soul, we know it. That is why we yearn so for relationships--and for relationships of meaning. It is also, no doubt, why we have such trouble with them. At some level, we must be very clear how much is at stake. Yet it is possible to have joyful relationships, and the extraordinary insights in theConversations with Godbooks show us how. Neale Donald Walsch on Relationshipsis inspirational, humorous, and practical. Neale examines the patterns that hinder our ability to build and maintain successful relationships; teaches us to move beyond restrictive ways of relating; and explores different types of relationships--with God, with self, with others--demonstrating how they all affect and enhance each other. If you want help in understanding relationships, here is a usable, powerful--and entertaining--key to opening the door to awareness.
 id : 239963 ISBN : 1571741658  | name : Neale Donald Walsch on Holistic Living  |  description : I have learned about life that when we live wholly, we live holy. I have been searching for ways to live my life as a whole person, as an integrated being, for twenty-five years. The first thing I came to understand was that, if I am to live an integrated life, I must become far more integrated with my environment. That is, I must become one with it, and treat it as if it were a part of me, not something from which I was separate, and which was separate from me. Holistic living means being aware that I am part of a whole system, a whole idea, a whole reality, and that everything I think, say, and do affects that reality--indeed, at some level, creates it. Are we able to coexist with nature, the universe, and our fellow human beings? Can we live lives that are joyous, harmonious, and largely pain-free? Do we have the ability to tell the truth and change what doesn't work? Neale Donald Walsch thinks so. Living well--physically, mentally, and spiritually--is within our grasp, should we choose to do so. Here are some practical and inspirational ideas for achieving those goals.

Hoping she'll be one of the vast majority of those who go on to lead full, productive lives relatively undisturbed by the disease, she takes off alone for the wilds of Alaska, leaving home, work, and family behind to live out her dream of a life filled with excitement and adventure. Janet spends the next several years amidst the spectacular beauty of the Alaskan wilderness, migrating with the change in seasons from her log cabin in the woods to a tiny fishing village on the coast. Her summers are spent climbing glaciers, fishing for crab, and sailing classic schooners. Winters are filled with dogsled racing, hot-air ballooning, and putting out to sea on a working ship. The MS begins to re-assert itself, however, in a chronic pattern of attacks and remissions, and she struggles to adjust - even submitting to twenty-six barehanded operations by the psychic surgeons of the Philippine Islands. As the disease progresses in rare, unexpected ways, a wheelchair finally becomes a necessity. She then enters a rehabilitation center and provides us with a graphic, unflinching look at what it takes to prepare for life with a serious disability. Janet James's penchant for black humor, cold beer, and handsome men results in numerous outsized tales. Her story is a frank, detailed account of life with a profound disability - a rare example of what MS can do. But through it all, she reminds us that life, regardless of its circumstances, truly is whatever we choose to make it.

Fruto de esa experiencia son los CUENTOS DE LA ALHAMBRA, volumen publicado inicialmente en Londres en 1832 y ampliado y revisado en la posterior edición neoyorquina. La obra, un clásico, combina las tradiciones moras con las cristianas, a través de una serie de cuentos y esbozos que recrean el pasado y reflejan también el presente desde el que escribía el autor.

 id : 240142 ISBN : 847584071X  | name : Llibre de les dones  |  description : Es poden comptar amb els dits duna mà les obres literàries catalanes medievals que, com ara el Llibre deies dones de Jaume Roig (1402?-1478), són capaces datraure linterès del lector actual amb una força tan abassegadora. Amb tot i això, l' Espill o Llibre dels consells, títols amb què també es coneix aquesta obra narrativa escrita a la segona meitat del segle XV i editada nombroses vegades dençà del segle XVI, fins ara resultava inaccessible al públic no especialitzat pel fet de ser escrita originàriament en vers i en un català no gens fàcil, malgrat que lautor hi faci servir un registre ben col·loquial o potser precisament per aquest motiu. Amb una gran destresa i en forma autobiogràfica, el Llibre de les dones narra latzarosa vida del protagonista des de la seva joventut, en què la mare el treu de casa i es veu obligat a vagar i dur una vida aventurera per terres catalanes i per França, fins a la vellesa, vista sobretot a través dels diversos fracassos matrimonials (amb una donzella, amb una beata, amb una viuda i amb una monja). Considerada com un precedent de la novel·la picaresca castellana, pel seu realisme i el seu aire divertit i pintoresc, el Llibre de les dones constitueix, per una banda, un violent atac contra les dones, ple denginy i de vivesa, dintre de la més pura tradició misógina a la manera del Corbaccio de Boccaccio i de l'Arcipreste de Talavera, i, per laltra, ofereix un autèntic fresc de la societat burgesa valenciana del segle XV. Introduïda i anotada amb rigor, aquesta acurada i fidel prosificació modernitzada del Llibre de les dones a càrrec de Jordi Tiñena posa per primera vegada a labast dels estudiants de segon ensenyament (BUP i FP) i del públic lector en general una de les obres més riques, divertides i representatives de la narrativa catalana del segle dor. Amb això, i amb els fragments de loriginal i una sèrie de propostes de treball, no es pretén fer altra cosa que el que la majoria de llengües de cultura han fet des de fa temps amb les obres antigues i clàssiques: facilitar-ne laccés al seu públic natural.
 id : 240147 ISBN : 0814796982  | name : Beyond the Shadow of Camptown  |  description : Explores the experiences of Korean military brides in the United States Since the beginning of the Korean War in 1950, nearly 100,000 Korean women have immigrated to the United States as the wives of American soldiers. Based on extensive oral interviews and archival research, Beyond the Shadow of Camptown tells the stories of these women, from their presumed association with U.S. military camptowns and prostitution to their struggles within the intercultural families they create in the United States. Historian Ji-Yeon Yuh argues that military brides are a unique prism through which to view cultural and social contact between Korea and the U.S. After placing these women within the context of Korean-U.S. relations and the legacies of both Japanese and U.S. colonialism vis á vis military prostitution, Yuh goes on to explore their lives, their coping strategies with their new families, and their relationships with their Korean families and homeland. Topics range from the personalthe role of food in their livesto the communalthe efforts of military wives to form support groups that enable them to affirm Korean identity that both American and Koreans would deny them. Relayed with warmth and compassion, this is the first in-depth study of Korean military brides, and is a groundbreaking contribution to Asian American, women's, and "new" immigrant studies, while also providing a unique approach to military history.

 id : 240318 ISBN : 0807031275  | name : Radical Equations  |  description : The remarkable story of the Algebra Project, a community-based effort to develop math-science literacy in disadvantaged schoolsas told by the programs founder Bob Moses was a hero of mine. His quiet confidence helped shape the civil rights movement, and he inspired generations of young people looking to make a differenceBarack Obama At a time when popular solutions to the educational plight of poor children of color are imposed from the outsidenational standards, high-stakes tests, charismatic individual saviorsthe acclaimed Algebra Project and its founder, Robert Moses, offer a vision of school reform based in the power of communities. Begun in 1982, the Algebra Project is transforming math education in twenty-five cities. Founded on the belief that math-science literacy is a prerequisite for full citizenship in society, the Project works with entire communitiesparents, teachers, and especially studentsto create a culture of literacy around algebra, a crucial stepping-stone to college math and opportunity. Telling the story of this remarkable program, Robert Moses draws on lessons from the 1960s Southern voter registration he famously helped organize: Everyone said sharecroppers didn't want to vote. It wasn't until we got them demanding to vote that we got attention. Today, when kids are falling wholesale through the cracks, people say they don't want to learn. We have to get the kids themselves to demand what everyone says they don't want. We see the Algebra Project organizing community by community. Older kids serve as coaches for younger students and build a self-sustained tradition of leadership. Teachers use innovative techniques. And we see the remarkable success stories of schools like the predominately poor Hart School in Bessemer, Alabama, which outscored the city's middle-class flagship school in just three years. Radical Equations provides a model for anyone looking for a community-based solution to the problems of our disadvantaged schools.

 id : 240357 ISBN : 0060196343  | name : The Cloud Sketcher  |  description : As the liner Ile de France docks in New York harbor, passengers notice with surprise the policemen gathered below and speculate as to which criminal among them will soon be apprehended. Here and there a single word floats above the general din: murder. Now and then a sage head tips knowingly in the direction of a flamboyant bootlegger: a crime of passion. But when the crowd begins to make its way down the gangplank, the notorious gangster slips through unmolested. Instead it's a celebrated architect with bums from a childhood accident partly covered by the patch over one eye -- who submits to authorities and is taken away in handcuffs. So begins The Cloud Sketcher, a passionate tale of love and war and art that ranges from the ice fields of the Arctic Circle at the dawn of the last century to the ruthless world of New York real estate speculation in the 1920s. In a tiny village in the northernmost reaches of Finland, a young boy named Esko Vaananen mourns the death of his mother, who died in the same fire that so horribly scarred his face. Miserably, impossibly in love with the beautiful daughter of a Russian aristocrat, Esko is at the brink of despair when, in the magical light of the aurora borealis, he has a vision of an impossibly tall building rising gracefully from the frozen lake and disappearing into the clouds above him. This pilvenpiirtaja--"cloud sketcher," or skyscraper sparks Esko's lifelong quest for beauty. He becomes an architect, believing that if he can create something of unparalleled loveliness, surely then he will be worthy of the love of Katerina Malysheva. This obsessive desire will cause Esko to risk everything time and again: as a reluctant hero in the bloody Battle of Tampere (the defining battle in the Finnish Civil War); as a laborer on the treacherous high steel of a riveting gang, hundreds of feet above Manhattan's city streets; as a player in the ruthless world of New York real estate speculation; and, finally, as a man accused of murdering the husband of the woman he loves. The Cloud Sketcher is a transforming journey into the heart of beauty and the peril of love, a romantic, lyrical epic that resurrects history with such authenticity and drama as to place Richard Rayner in the company of our very best novelists.

 id : 240385 ISBN : 0002244705  | name : Charity  |  description : No musician has lived a more transformational, or more tragic, life than Charlie Parker, one of the most talented and influential figures of the twentieth century. From the start of his career in the late 1930s, Parker was a new kind of American artist: a revolutionary musician who internalized all of popular music and blew it back through his alto saxophone "at the tempo of emergency"--even as he wrestled with a drug addiction that would ultimately contribute to his death at thirty-four. Yet no writer has fully captured the arc and texture of Parker's personal story . . . until now. Kansas City Lightning, the first in a two-volume life of Parker by Stanley Crouch, draws on decades of original interviews with peers, collaborators, and family members to reveal Parker as he emerged from the landscapes--literal and artistic--that he inhabited. A precocious child, shy yet self-possessed, Charlie ventured early into the nightlife of wide-open Depression Kansas City, a veritable stomping ground for such bandleaders as Walter Page, Bennie Moten, and Moten's successor, Count Basie, the king of Kansas City swing. Inspired by saxophonists Lester Young and Chu Berry, trumpeter Roy Eldridge, and his mentor Buster Smith, Parker endured initial humiliation on the bandstand--yet persevered until he mastered the idiom and began to transcend it. Kansas City Lightning follows Parker from the "freak shows" and "spook breakfasts" of late-night Kansas City, to the segregated union halls of Chicago, and finally to New York's Harlem ballrooms. Most intimately, it brings us into young Charlie Parker's family circle, as he plunged headlong into a very adult world--lured by both music and drugs, torn between his oddly protective mother and Rebecca Ruffin, the impressionable young woman whose romance with Charlie is at the bittersweet heart of this story. With the musical wisdom of a lifetime jazz scholar, the cultural insights of an indispensable social critic, and the narrative skill of a writer at the height of his powers, Crouch brings Parker back to glorious, surprising, and deeply moving life.

Dipped in Shadow shows her at her strongest, the book's five poems making hard-hitting statements about women and their children. "O what are you thinking my sisters," the book's foreword, draws women of all races together in the fundamental facts of female life: fear for themselves and fear for their children. In "Night Dances," a frightening story of sexual and physical abuse, knife-sharp language and experimental form expand words far beyond their usual connotations. "Sister (Y)our Manchild" reminds women that the cruellest soldiers in the most vicious wars are their babies; they have nurtured evil in their beautiful children. "This Fierce Body" reviews the life of a young man dying of AIDS as friends watch at his bedside. Experimental form and language make "Woeman Womb Prisoned," a harrowing evocation of a teenager in childbirth, both moving and provocative.

 id : 240465 ISBN : 0393315215  | name : George Eliot, Voice of a Century  |  description : Frederick R. Karl's magisterial biography of George Eliot proves her to be one of the most fascinating and iconic individuals of her time. Born in 1819 as Mary Anne Evans, she grew up near rural Coventry when the pastoral life was being destroyed by the rapid rise of industrialism. Her father, Robert Evans, took care of an estate, where the family lived. Eliot, his youngest child, absorbed the world around her, its beauty and its delicate sense of stability, which was about to be thoroughly disrupted. Eliot thrived on learning while she stayed home, taking care of her aging father. Upon his death, she began her long process of emergence and change. Her unusual intelligence and literary capacity brought her to the attention of John Chapman, who enlisted her to work on the intellectual Westminster Review in London. While there she met some of the leading thinkers of her era, including Herbert Spencer. Karl focuses on her relationships with these men in a way earlier biographers have been unable, using many letters and documents previously unavailable.

 id : 240562 ISBN : 0060924756  | name : The Best Kind of Loving  |  description : It has often been said that "if white America has a case of the sniffles, Black America catches walking pneumonia." When this credo is applied to relationships, common problems such as inadequate communication, commitment fears, financial struggles and infidelity carry an even greater weight. Yet, with hundreds of relationship books on the market, virtually none has explored the specific circumstances impacting relationships between African-American men and women. In The Best Kind of Loving: A Black Woman's Guide to Finding Intimacy, renowned psychologist Dr. Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant addresses head-on the complex challenges in African-American relationships. "In addition to the social dynamics affecting male-female communications in general, as African-Americans, we carry the added burdens of myths and stereotypes that grow out of our real history of slavery, second-class citizenship and economic disenfranchisement," Grant explains. In writing The Best Kind of Loving, Grant has provided an invaluable resource for Black women searching to understand the choices they make, the men they love and how to make the most of their strength, intelligence and wit. Compulsively readable, The Best Kind of Loving is unique in its scope and vision; women of all races and backgrounds will laugh, sympathize and nod their heads in recognition as they read about others not unlike themselves. Giving both pragmatic and realistic advice, Grant serves both as an advisor and confidant; she knows which situations may not work out, but also gives women ways to make the best of less-than-ideal circumstances.

But fresh back from a family vacation in Florida, Clifford is hit with a stunning blow when his wife Demetria declares that she is leaving him for true love, excitement, and funan announcement that throws him into an uncontrollable tailspin of denial. With one failed marriage under his belt, and a precious daughter his ex-wife bars him from seeing, Victor is no expert in romantic love. His philosophy? The only way to keep a woman from squeezing every last drop from you is to get out before things get too deep. But lately Victor hasnt been feeling quite like himselfespecially since hes been falling for Edie and her little girl. Seems like he spends more time looking out for her then he does staking out new booty calls. Even in the face of tragedy and travail, Nathan, a minister, remains hopeful. His marriage is a paragon of Christian ideals, his loving wife Brenda is his soul mate and support. But it wasnt always that way. Nathan has left some ugly wreckage in his wake before finding God. Now he and Brenda are truly blessed with a solid family and an adoring congregation. Then, a troubled divorcée tempts Nathanand threatens the sacred vows he swore to uphold. While Clifford, Victor, and Nathan struggle with the unexpectedfaltering marriages, breaking hearts, and torn childhoods that threaten to repeat themselves in the lives of their childreneach will discover the true redemptive power of a brothers love. By turns fierce and passionate, tender and humorous, this wise novel blasts the stereotype that black mens ties to their families are tenuous at best. Freddie Lee Johnson III tells a refreshing story of three complex men who fight to do right by their familiesboth the ones they created, and the one they were born into. The result is Bittersweet.

 id : 240588 ISBN : 0380797011  | name : Live Writing  |  description : This book is based on the simple idea that every writer has a "tool box." Instead of awls and hammers, a writer's toolbox contains words, imagination, a love of books, a sense of story, and ideas for how to make the writing live and breathe. I wrote this book to give you some practical strategies to throw into your toolbox. I hope you'll try them, because these are ideas that can make you a better writer. This book is titled Live Writing, and you may be wondering what I mean by that. Most of us have read (and written!) the opposite kind of writing-dull, drab language that sounds about as interesting as a city phone book. By "live writing" I mean the kind of writing that has a current running through it-energy, electricity, juice. When we read "live writing", the words seem to lift off the page and burrow deep inside us.

 id : 240691 ISBN : 0192826336  | name : Four Revenge Tragedies  |  description : The Revenge Tragedy flourished in Britain in the late Elizabethan and Jacobean period for both literary and cultural reasons. Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (1587) helped to establish the popularity of the genre, and it was followed by The Revenger's Tragedy (1606), published anonymously and ascribed first to Cyril Tourneur and then to Thomas Middleton. George Chapman's The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois and Tourneur's The Atheist's Tragedy were written between 1609 and 1610. Each of the four plays printed here defines the problems of the revenge genre, often by exploiting its conventions in unexpected directions. All deal with fundamental moral questions about the meaning of justice and the lengths to which victimized individuals may go to obtain it, while registering the social strains of life in a rigid but increasingly fragile social hierarchy.

 id : 240740 ISBN : 0141439750  | name : Silas Marner  |  description : George Eliot's tale of a solitary miser gradually redeemed by the joy of fatherhood, Silas Marner is edited with an introduction and notes by David Carroll in Penguin Classics. Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life. This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll's introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis. Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published Scenes of Clerical Life, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of 'George Eliot', including The Mill on the Floss, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda. If you enjoyed Silas Marner, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, also available in Penguin Classics. 'I think Silas Marner holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

An engrossing work of history."John Gray, New Statesman "Cranston's painstaking archival research and lucid style yield the most detailed and thoroughly documented biography of Rousseau written in English. His epilogue masterfully sums up Rousseau's importance as political philosopher and initiator of romantic sensibilities."Choice "Anyone curious about the paradoxes of a most paradoxical man will not go wrong by starting with this invaluable biography."James Miller, Washington Post Book World "As absorbing as a picaresque novel."Naomi Bliven, New Yorker "A monument of scholarship. . . .

 id : 240825 ISBN : 0192802380  | name : Pride and Prejudice  |  description : 'his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!' Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and menide down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly by its captivating wisdom.

 id : 240840 ISBN : 0716747014  | name : Newton's Tyranny  |  description : One of the great figures in history, Sir Isaac Newton personifies the triumph of scientific reason over ignorance. Yet for all his contributions to the Enlightenment, Newton was a deeply complex man who sometimes aggressively tried to obscure the intellectual achievements of others of others. Newton's Tyranny is the story of two men who felt the full wrath of the great man's hostility-the Reverend John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, and Stephen Gray, a humble dyer and amateur scientist. United not only by a love of science, but by a bitter and protracted conflict with Newton, the two men made significant contributions to science despite the observational astronomy and navigation. Drawing upon letters and historical documents, Newton's Tyranny vividly recreates the British scientific community of the early 18th century. It was an era of great achievement, but the crucible of science was often heated by Machiavellian intrigue, uncontrollable ambition, and larger-than-life personalities. Against this dramatic setting, the saga of Newton, Flamsteed and Gray unfolds, a story of loyalty and commitment against great odds. A fascinating look at a forgotten piece of science history, Newton's Tyranny exposes the dark side of flawed genius while celebrating the ultimate triumph of two unsung heroes.

In ENDGAME Ritter has compiled an exciting, tense account of the cat-and-mouse game the inspection teams played with duplicitous Iraqi officials, set against the shifting sands of international diplomacy. He describes how, even as the inspectors were risking their lives to uncover Saddam's deadly weapons, the programme was being betrayed as the French, the Russians and finally the US lobbied to soften UN policy. He also reveals both how the US manipulated the inspections for their own ends and the shadowy role played by the CIA. He knows better than anyone what weapons Saddam has and he lists Iraq's destructive capacity in chilling detail. Combined with an insightful analysis of how Saddam came to power and how he retains a despotic grip on the country, Ritter clearly demonstrates that it is only a matter of time before Saddam unleashes his weapons of mass destruction again. Above all he uses his unique knowledge of Iraq to outline a plan for dealing with Saddam Hussein. The attempts to bomb Saddam into submission have clearly failed. France and Russia are prepared to turn a blind eye as Saddam rebuilds his arsenal. The US has no long-term solution. Scott Ritter's plan could be the only way forward.

Post-war austerity is still with us, but the younger style is making itself felt - and Potter's rock 'n' roll music reflects this.

During his first year at Stanford Business School, the author began keeping a journal of his day-to-day impressions which evolved into this book, the writing of which he came to see as a "simple act of decency, like going back to the last calm bend in the river and nailing up a sign that reads 'Waterfall Ahead'". From his initial harrowing days at "maths camp" through the dizzying phalanx of core courses, the frenzy of the exam week, the pitfalls and triumphs of the interview process (including a surreal interview with Robert Maxwell) to being wined and dined by some of the most prestigious companies in the world, Robinson's account is an irreverent story peopled with a wide range of characters.

In a vivid history that is stranger than fiction, Ether Day tells the story of the three men who converged to invent the first anesthesia  and the war of ego and greed that soon sent all three men spiraling wildly out of control.

Extracto: ...of the same work; though it is-a great proof of a man's inferior nature when he does not know how to make his wife his mistress. Constancy will ever be the genius of Love; the sign of an immense force, --the force that constitutes a poet. A man should find all women in his wife, --just as the soiled poets of the seventeenth century made Chloes and Daphnes of their Manons. "Well," said Lisbeth to Wenceslas, as soon as she saw him thoroughly fascinated, " what do you think of Valerie?" "Too charming " he answered. "You would n't listen to me," exclaimed Bette. "Ah, my little Wenceslas if you and I had stayed together you should have been the lover of this siren; you should have married her when she became a widow, and had the benefit of her forty thousand francs a year." "Has she all that?" "Certainly," said Bette. "But take care now what you are about; I have warned you of your danger; don't burn your fingers. Come, give rue your arm, dinner is ready." No speech could have been more demoralizing to a Pole; show him a precipice and he springs over it. The Polish race has the distinctive genius of cavalry; it believes in flinging itself headlong against obstacles and coming out victorious. The spur with which Lisbeth prodded his vanity was enforced by the scene in the dining-room, where an exquisite silver service made him conscious of the elegancies and refinements of Parisian luxury. "I should have done better," he reflected, "to have married Celimene." During dinner Hulot, who was pleased to find his son-in-law present, and still more pleased at the certainty of reconciliation with Valerie, of whose fidelity he now felt sure, since he could promise her Coquet's place, made himself delightful....

 id : 240986 ISBN : 0553382047  | name : Last of the Amazons  |  description : The author of the international bestsellers Gates of Fire and Tides of War delivers his most gripping and imaginative novel of the ancient worlda stunning epic of love and war that breathes life into the grand myth of the ferocious female warrior culture of the Amazons. Steven Pressfield has gained a passionate worldwide following for his magnificent novels of ancient Greece, Gates of Fire and Tides of War. In Last of the Amazons, Pressfield has surpassed himself, re-creating a vanished world in a brilliant novel that will delight his loyal readers and bring legions more to his singular and powerful restoration of the past. In the time before Homer, the legendary Theseus, King of Athens (an actual historical figure), set sail on a journey that brought him into the land of tal Kyrte, the free people, a nation of proud female warriors whom the Greeks called Amazons. The Amazons, bound to each other as lovers as well as fighters, distrusted the Greeks, with their boastful talk of civilization. So when the great war queen Antiope fell in love with Theseus and fled with the Greeks, the mighty Amazon nation rose up in rage. Last of the Amazons is not merely a masterful tale of war and revenge. Pressfield has created a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters, from the unforgettable Selene, whose surrender to the Greeks does nothing to tame her; to her lover, Damon, an Athenian warrior who grows to cherish the wild Amazon ways; to the narrator, Bones, a young girl from a noble family who was nursed by Selene from birth and secretly taught the Amazon way; to the great Theseus, the tragic king; and to Antiope, the noble queen who betrayed tal Kyrte for the love of Theseus. With astounding immediacy and extraordinary attention to military detail, Pressfield transports readers into the heat and terror of war. Equally impressive is his creation of the Amazon nation, its people, its rituals and myths, its greatness and savagery. Last of the Amazons is thrilling on every page, an epic tale of the clash between wildness and civilization, patriotism and love, man and woman.

 id : 240996 ISBN : 207037811X  | name : De si braves garçons  |  description : Aux environs de Paris, le collège de Valvert, surnommé le Château en raison de son parc, de ses pavillons et de ses bois, a pour pensionnaires de " braves garçons " plus ou moins abandonnés par leurs familles -des gens riches ou ruinés, instables, cosmopolites, suspects.

 id : 240999 ISBN : 0465039138  | name : Code  |  description : There's a common belief that cyberspace cannot be regulatedthat it is, in its very essence, immune from the government's (or anyone else's) control. Code argues that this belief is wrong. It is not in the nature of cyberspace to be unregulable; cyberspace has no nature. It only has codethe software and hardware that make cyberspace what it is. That code can create a place of freedomas the original architecture of the Net didor a place of exquisitely oppressive control.If we miss this point, then we will miss how cyberspace is changing. Under the influence of commerce, cyberpsace is becoming a highly regulable space, where our behavior is much more tightly controlled than in real space.But that's not inevitable either. We canwe mustchoose what kind of cyberspace we want and what freedoms we will guarantee. These choices are all about architecture: about what kind of code will govern cyberspace, and who will control it. In this realm, code is the most significant form of law, and it is up to lawyers, policymakers, and especially citizens to decide what values that code embodies.
 id : 241001 ISBN : 0262560925  | name : Computers and Thought  |  description : Computers and Thought showcases the work of the scientists who not only defined the field of Artificial Intelligence, but who are responsible for having developed it into what it is today. Originally published in 1963, this collection includes twenty classic papers by such pioneers as A. M.

Among the now hard-to-find articles are reports of computer programs that play chess and checkers, prove theorems in logic and geometry, solve problems in calculus, balance assembly lines, recognize visual temporal patterns, and communicate in natural language. The reports of simulation of cognitive processes include computer models of human behavior in logic problems, deciding on common stock portfolios, and carrying out social interaction. Models of verbal learning behavior, predictive behavior in two-choice experiments, and concept formation are also included. Articles by : Paul Armer. Carol Chomsky. Geoffrey P. E. Clarkson. Edward A. Feigenbaum. Julian Feldman. H. Gelernter. Bert F. Green, Jr. John T. Gullahorn. Jeanne E. Gullahorn. J. R. Hansen. Carl I. Hovland. Earl B. Hunt. Kenneth Laughery. Robert K. Lindsay. D. W. Loveland.

But this is more than just an entertaining tale.

 id : 241013 ISBN : 0880642068  | name : Through Emotions to Maturity  |  description : "Throughout her work, Verena Kast has stressed the importance of emotions. If we don't take them seriously and try to avoid them, we become psychological cripples, unable to unfold our true selves and realize our potential." "In Through Emotions to Maturity Dr. Kast looks at eight classic fairy tales that deal with different aspects of emotions which are difficult to endure - anxiety, fear, and angst. In trying to overcome them, we may enter into a symbiotic relationship which gives us the illusion of being protected: by fusing with a group of people, an institution, or another person, etc., we feel safe and sound, while at the same time we suffocate psychologically, losing our freedoms and the ability to grow." "The fairy tales discussed in this volume illustrate the danger of psychological symbiosis as an attempt to escape fear. Yet they also offer alternatives. Originally told for adults, fairy tales stem from dreams and contain the wisdom of our unconscious. If we decipher their images and symbols, they release a knowledge that can be of extreme importance to us. Under Kast's authoritative guidance, fairy tales thus offer us a way out of the cycle of fear and symbiosis."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Volume I contains 100 unabridged tales, including those best-known around the world: "Cinderella, Snow White, Rapunzel, Hansel And Gretel, and "Little Red Cap [also known as "Little Red Riding Hood ].

And then, because this is a book that tells us more, we read of the accidents that saved lives - the gun that failed to shoot, the car that ran out of gas, the dog whose cries alerted the family." "Finally, and gloriously, we read of the return to life. And the stories of how certain individuals have taken hold of life once again, slowly leaving the pain behind, changing their situations, finding new reservoirs of strength and determination."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

 id : 241099 ISBN : 0553104934  | name : Zeitgeist  |  description : Bruce Sterling is "perhaps the sharpest observer of our media-choked culture working today" (Time), offering haunting visions of a future shaped by a madness of our own making. His latest novel is a startling tragicomic spectacle that takes a breathtaking look at a world where the future is being chased down by the past.... Zeitgeist It's 1999 in Cyprus, an ancient island bejeweled with blue-helmeted UN peacekeepers and littered with rusting land mines, corroding barbed wire, and illegal sewage dumps. Here, in the Turkish half of the island, the ever-enterprising Leggy Starlitz has alighted, pausing on his mission to storm the Third World with the "G-7" girls, the cheapest, phoniest all-girl band ever to wear Wonderbras and spandex. And his market is staring him in the face: millions of teenagers trapped in a world of mullahs and mosques, all ready to blow their pocket change on G-7's massive merchandising campaign--and to wildly anticipate music the group will never release. Leggy's brilliant plan means doing business with some of the world's most dangerous people. His business partner is the rich and connected Mehmet Ozbey, a man with many identities and a Turkish girlfriend whose beauty and singing voice could blow G-7 right out of the water. His security chief is Pulat Romanevich Khoklov, who learned to fly MiG combat jets in Afghanistan and now pilots Milosevic's personal airplane. Among these thieves, schemers, and killers, Leggy must act quickly and decisively. Bombs are dropping in Yugoslavia. Y2K is just around the corner. And the only rule to live by is that the whole scheme stops before the year 2000. But Leggy gets a surprise when the daughter he's never met arrives on his doorstep. A major fan of G-7, she is looking for a father--and her search forces Leggy to examine his life before making a madcap journey in search of a father of his own. It's a detour that puts his G-7 Zeitgeist in some real jeopardy. For in Istanbul, Leggy's former partners are getting restless, and the G-7 girls are beginning to die....Zeitgeist is a world-beat tale of smugglers, paparazzi, greed, war, and a new era of cultural crusades. Here Bruce Sterling proves once again that in the fiction of imagination, he is one of the most insightful writers of our time.

And in the case of Collins, the experience can be a very exhilarating one indeed. His poems shuttle us back and forth between the realms of the clear and the mysterious, often carrying us from the everyday into imaginative territory we never knew existed.One of his new poems, "No Time, " is a fine example: In a rush this weekday morning, tap the horn as I speed past the cemeterywhere my parents are buriedside by side under a smooth slab of granite.Then, all day long, I think of him rising upto give me that lookof knowing disapprovalwhile my mother calmly tells him to lie back down.

His subjects range from a bakery early in the morning to the fingerprints on a stranger's front door; from waiters in an empty restaurant to the decorations in a window of a funeral home; from a dog tied to a chain to a homeless man sleeping at the foot of a skyscraper; and other moments of solitude and clear vision. "What is beautiful," he writes in one poem, "is found accidentally and not sought after. What is beautiful is easily lost." Simic is the metaphysician of the ordinary, a poet who reminds us of the mysteries of our daily lives.

 id : 241113 ISBN : 0679463224  | name : Tomorrow Now  |  description : Nobody knows better than Bruce Sterling how thin the membrane between science fiction and real life has become, a state he correctly depicts as both thrilling and terrifying in this frisky, literate, clear-eyed sketch of the next half-century. Like all of the most interesting futurists, Sterling isnt just talking about machines and biochemistry: what he really cares about are the interstices of technology with culture and human history. -Kurt Andersen, author of Turn of the Century Visionary author Bruce Sterling views the future like no other writer. In his first nonfiction book since his classic The Hacker Crackdown, Sterling describes the world our children might be living in over the next fifty years and what to expect next in culture, geopolitics, and business. Time calls Bruce Sterling one of Americas best-known science fiction writers and perhaps the sharpest observer of our media-choked culture working today in any genre. Tomorrow Now is, as Sterling wryly describes it, an ambitious, sprawling effort in thundering futurist punditry, in the pulsing vein of the futurists Ive read and admired over the years: H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and Alvin Toffler; Lewis Mumford, Reyner Banham, Peter Drucker, and Michael Dertouzos. This book asks the future two questions: What does it mean? and How does it feel?  Taking a cue from one of William Shakespeares greatest soliloquies, Sterling devotes one chapter to each of the seven stages of humanity: birth, school, love, war, politics, business, and old age. As our children progress through Sterlings Shakespearean life cycle, they will encounter new products; new weapons; new crimes; new moral conundrums, such as cloning and genetic alteration; and new political movements, which will augur the way wars of the future will be fought. Here are some of the authors predictions:  Human clone babies will grow into the bitterest and surliest adolescents ever.  Microbes will be more important than the family farm.  Consumer items will look more and more like cuddly, squeezable pets.  Tomorrows kids will learn more from randomly clicking the Internet than they ever will from their textbooks.  Enemy governments will be nice to you and will badly want your tourist money, but global outlaws will scheme to kill you, loudly and publicly, on their Jihad TVs.  The future of politics is blandness punctuated with insanity. The future of activism belongs to a sophisticated, urbane global network that can make moneythe Disney World version of Al Qaeda. Tomorrow Now will change the way you think about the future and our place in it.

 id : 241120 ISBN : 0674805518  | name : Shanghai Modern  |  description : In the midst of ChinaÕs wild rush to modernize, a surprising note of reality arises: Shanghai, it seems, was once modern indeed, a pulsing center of commerce and art in the heart of the twentieth century. This book immerses us in the golden age of Shanghai urban culture, a modernity at once intrinsically Chinese and profoundly anomalous, blending new and indigenous ideas with those flooding into this Òtreaty portÓ from the Western world. A preeminent specialist in Chinese studies, Leo Ou-fan Lee gives us a rare wide-angle view of Shanghai culture in the making. He shows us the architecture and urban spaces in which the new commercial culture flourished, then guides us through the publishing and filmmaking industries that nurtured a whole generation of artists and established a bold new style in urban life known as modeng. In the work of six writers of the time, particularly Shi Zhecun, Mu Shiying, and Eileen Chang, Lee discloses the reflection of ShanghaiÕs urban landscapeÑforeign and familiar, oppressive and seductive, traditional and innovative. This work acquires a broader historical and cosmopolitan context with a look at the cultural links between Shanghai and Hong Kong, a virtual genealogy of Chinese modernity from the 1930s to the present day.

How can music make sense to an ear and brain evolved for detecting the approaching lion or tracking the unsuspecting gazelle? Lyrically interweaving discoveries from science, psychology, music theory, paleontology, and philosophy, Robert Jourdian brilliantly examines why music speaks to us in ways that words cannot, and why we form such powerful connections to it. In clear, understandable language, Jourdian expertly guides the reader through a continuum of musical experience: sound, tone, melody, harmony, rhythm, composition, performance, listening, understanding--and finally to ecstasy. Along the way, a fascinating cast of characters brings Jourdian's narrative to vivid life: "idiots savants" who absorb whole pieces on a single hearing, composers who hallucinate entire compositions, a psychic who claims to take dictation from long-dead composers, and victims of brain damage who can move only when they hear music. Here is a book that will entertain, inform, and stimulate everyone who loves music--and make them think about their favorite song in startling new ways.What makes a distant oboe s wail beautiful?

Far-ranging and provocative, The Big Bang Never Happened is more than a critique of one of the primary theories of astronomy -- that the universe appeared out of nothingness in a single cataclysmic explosion ten to twenty billion years ago. Drawing on new discoveries in particle physics and thermodynamics as well as on readings in history and philosophy, Eric J. Lerner confronts the values behind the Big Bang theory: the belief that mathematical formulae are superior to empirical observation; that the universe is finite and decaying; and that it could only come into being through some outside force. With inspiring boldness and scientific rigor, he offers a brilliantly orchestrated argument that generates explosive intellectual debate. "From the Trade Paperback edition.

Especialmente después de la caída del bloque comunista, que los dejó como única superpotencia mundial. ¿Cuales son las raíces del antimericanismo? ¿Posee una base objetiva? ¿Responde al conocimiento de los hechos de la realidad o se explica sólo por un resentimiento irracional alimentado por los fantasmas y la desinformación?

A esto se dedica Jean-François Revel en La obsesión antiamericana. ¿Cómo son vistos los Estados Unidos por los demás y cómo son en realidad? La respuesta es una inteligente denuncia de las contradicciones del antimericanismo y de las incongruencias de los críticos de la globalización liberal.

A playful and biting critique, Ugresic's essays hit on all of the major aspects of publishing: agents, subagents, and scouts, supermarket-like bookstores, Joan Collins, book fairs that have little to do with books, authors promoted because of sex appeal instead of merit, and editors trying to look like writers by having their photograph taken against a background of bookshelves. Thanks to cultural influences such as Oprah, "The Today Show," and Kelly Ripa, best-seller lists have become just a modern form of socialist realism, a manifestation of a society that generally ignores literature in favor of the next big thing.

 id : 241231 ISBN : 0312280734  | name : Carp Fishing on Valium  |  description : The literary debut of one of rock's most critically acclaimed singer/songwriters. For 25 years Graham Parker has rocked our world, releasing more than 20 albums, including the fabled Squeezing Out Sparks, considered to be one of the great rock and roll albums of all time. Now Graham stakes his claim in the literary world with Carp Fishing on Valium. Carp Fishing on Valium is the story of one Brian Porker, our Everyman if you will, told in a kaleidoscopic series of episodes from Brian's life: from a nature-loving lad who collects bird eggs to a wannabe musician enduring distasteful jobs; from a husband with a different kind of relationship problem to a high-living rock singer auditioning as the replacement for the "newly deceased" Mick Jagger; and from a homeowner negotiating with country workmen to his final guise as an ornithologist-comedian (yes, you read that right). Witty, absurd, keenly insightful and full of a wistfulness for what once was and what might have been, Carp Fishing on Valium establishes Graham Parker on the literary scene in the same wickedly incisive way he turned rock on its ear.

 id : 241237 ISBN : 0375405836  | name : Jesse James  |  description : A brilliant biography of Jesse James, and a stunning reinterpretation of an American icon. Stripped of the familiar myths surrounding him, James emerges a far more significant figure: ruthless, purposeful, intensely political; a man who, in the midst of his crimes and notoriety, made himself a spokesman for the renewal of the Confederate cause during the bitter decade that followed Appomattox. Traditionally, Jesse James has been portrayed as a Wild West bandit, a Robin Hood of sorts. But in this meticulously researched, vividly written account of his life, he emerges as far more complicated. Raised in a fiercely pro-slavery atmosphere in bitterly divided Missouri, he began at sixteen to fight alongside some of the most savage Confederate guerrillas. When the Civil War ended, his violent path led him into the brutal conflicts of Reconstruction. We follow James as he places himself squarely in the forefront of the former Confederates' bid to capture political power with his reckless daring, his visibility, his partisan pronouncements, and his alliance with a rising ex-Confederate editor, John Newman Edwards, who helped shape James's image for their common purpose. In uniting violence and the news media on behalf of a political cause, James was hardly the quaint figure of legend. Rather, as his life played out across the racial divide, the rise of the Klan, and the expansion of the railroads, he was a forerunner of what we have come to call a terrorist. T.J. Stiles has written a memorable book--a revelation of both the man and his time.

 id : 241240 ISBN : 0802714064  | name : Edison and the Electric Chair  |  description : A Discover magazine Top Science Book Thomas Edison stunned America in 1879 by unveiling a world-changing invention--the light bulb--and then launching the electrification of Americas cities. A decade later, despite having been an avowed opponent of the death penalty, Edison threw his laboratory resources and reputation behind the creation of a very different sort of device--the electric chair. Deftly exploring this startling chapter in American history, Edison & the Electric Chair delivers both a vivid portrait of a nation on the cusp of modernity and a provocative new examination of Edison himself. Edison championed the electric chair for reasons that remain controversial to this day. Was Edison genuinely concerned about the suffering of the condemned? Was he waging a campaign to smear his rival George Westinghouses alternating current and boost his own system? Or was he warning the public of real dangers posed by the high-voltage alternating wires that looped above hundreds of Americas streets? Plumbing the fascinating history of electricity, Mark Essig explores Americas love of technology and its fascination with violent death, capturing an era when the public was mesmerized and terrified by an invisible force that produced blazing light, powered streetcars, carried telephone conversations--and killed.

 id : 241242 ISBN : 0786886404  | name : The Frozen Water Trade  |  description : Now in paperback, the fascinating story of America's vast natural ice trade which revolutionized the 19th century. On February 13, 1806, the brig Favorite left Boston harbor bound for the Caribbean island of Martinique with a cargo that few imagined would survive the month-long voyage. Packed in hay in the hold were large chunks of ice cut from a frozen Massachusetts lake. This was the first venture of a young Boston entrepreneur, Frederic Tudor, who believed he could make a fortune selling ice to people in the tropics. Ridiculed at the outset, Tudor endured years of hardship before he was to fulfill his dream. Over the years, he and his rivals extended the frozen-water trade to Havana, Charleston, New Orleans, London, and finally to Calcutta, where in 1833 more than one hundred tons of ice survived a four-month journey of 16,000 miles with two crossings of the equator. The Frozen-Water Trade is a fascinating account of the birth of an industry that ultimately revolutionized domestic life for millions of people.
 id : 241243 ISBN : 0375756930  | name : Uncle Tom's Cabin  |  description : When Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852, it became an international blockbuster, selling more than 300,000 copies in the United States alone in its first year. Progressive for her time, Harriet Beecher Stowe was one of the earliest writers to offer a shockingly realistic depiction of slavery. Her stirring indictment and portrait of human dignity in the most inhumane circumstances enlightened hundreds of thousands by revealing the human costs of slavery, which had until then been cloaked and justified by the racist misperceptions of the time. Langston Hughes called it "a moral battle cry," noting that "the love and warmth and humanity that went into its writing keep it alive a century later," and Tolstoy described it as "flowing from love of God and man."

 id : 241255 ISBN : 0811817865  | name : Observations from the Bar  |  description : Throughout jazz history there have been nightclubs where the music and the atmosphere live on to become legendary, like Minton's in Harlem or Lincoln Gardens in Chicago. In Paris in the late 1940's , it was Aerobleu -- notorious for its all-night jam sessions and its enigmatic owner, Max Morgan. In the heady chaos and excitement of postwar Paris, in a time that was every bit as shadowy, as sensual, as idealistic as it was reported to be, all paths crossed at Aerobleu. Drawn by a feverish mix of music and martinis, Janet Flanner, Hemingway, Picasso, and Bogart all flocked to hear the best jazz this side of Harlem. And when Max Morgon won an old DC-3 in an all-night poker game, Miles Davis and Max Roach were there, giving flight to the music in legendary jam sessions en route to New York, Paris, London, and New Orleans. In the late 1950s, the ever-elusive Max Morgan disappeared, vanishing mysteriously from Havana, leaving behind some of the best jazz ever played and a state of mind that has come to be known as "Aerobleu."

 id : 241262 ISBN : 0811812618  | name : Horace Bristol  |  description : In the tradition of the great photographic populists Alfred Eisenstaedt and Dorothea Lange, Horace Bristol used his camera to record the human, intimate movements in the grand sweep of history. Bristol's American view included the best and the worst of this century, from poignant images of the urban poor and migrant farm workers during the Depression to the battle scenes of World War II and compelling portraits of post-war Japan and Southeast Asia. One of the first staff photographers for Life magazine, Bristol was tireless in his pursuit of the revelatory image. Wildly prolific in the thirties and forties, he later gave up photography, and his work languished in obscurity for nearly thirty years. Recently rediscovered, Bristol has come to be recognized as one of the most important photographers of the twentieth century. This volume presents over one hundred twenty exquisitely reproduced duotone images by Bristol, ranging from his early San Francisco photographs to his last work, taken in Southeast Asia. Combining aesthetic purity with human interest, Horace Bristol's pioneering photography is imbued with an accuracy, strength of composition, and humility that is as striking today as it was groundbreaking in its time.

 id : 241355 ISBN : 1567311474  | name : The West  |  description : Eliot Porter has photographed the American West throughout his long and illustrious career, finding in this region one of the purest expressions of our natural environment--its fragile balance as well as its power and majesty. Although his classic Sierra Club publications, among them books on Glen Canyon, Summer Island in Maine, and Baja California, have enhanced the appreciation of this vast region for generations of Americans, until now no single book has conveyed the depth and stirring scope of his vision. For this inspirational portfolio, New York Graphic Society Books has drawn extensively on the artist's personal archive (all but a handful of images have never been published before) to create the quintessential view of Eliot Porter's West. Indeed, this volume encompasses the entire region, from the area around Porter's home in Santa Fe to the precipice of Big Sur, from the canyonlands and the saguaro deserts to the peak of Mount Rainier. Whether photographing a lovely detail of wildflowers on a mountainside or the "silver ribbon" of the Colorado River as it courses through the breathtaking panorama of the Grand Canyon, Porter never fails to communicate his passion for the natural world via his impeccable eye for color and form.

 id : 241377 ISBN : 0195056892  | name : City Lights  |  description : The second edition of this successful urban studies text has been fully updated to highlight issues facing cities in an ever-shrinking global society. Skillfully blending perspectives from the social sciences with insights from the visual arts and humanities, this lively and imaginative text provides a comprehensive introduction to cities and how they work. Focusing on the U.S. city, it covers the major traditional topics, including urbanization and suburbanization, the two faces of community, spatial and social structure, economic base, and decision-making. In addition, the revised edition treats such specialized topics as personal space, and the impact of new technologies on architecture and politics. Phillips takes the point of view that what you see depends on how you look at it and how you define an urban problem determines its solution. In systematic fashion, she shows how scholarly controversy and public debates over urban policy are rooted in deep-seated differences: differences in political ideologies, research methods, theoretical orientations, academic disciplines, and/or levels of analysis. Phillips starts from several basic premises: no one has cornered the truth about cities (or anything else); even the loneliest town is linked in a worldwide system due to the urban-global interlock, and things urban-suburban are best understood in a broader context from an interdisciplinary outlook. The book offers numerous case studies, photoessays, examples, and firsthand accounts of such interesting and timely subjects as ethnic identity, ZIP codes as neighborhoods, big cities in poor countries, women's space, alternative urban-suburban futures, multiculturalism, temporary or contingent work, the entanglement of race and class, gated communities, and local fiscal crisis, placing these issues in broad analytical contexts. Developed and tested in the classroom, this rich and highly readable text features a wide range of illustrative materials and learning aids. Projects in each chapter and the books evenhanded approach to a variety of perspectives encourage students to develop their personal acquaintance with and knowledge about urban life. Excerpts from classic works, lists of key terms, and suggestions for further learning make this book a valuable tool for students in urban studies and a variety of urban-oriented courses, particularly urban sociology, city planning, urban politics, and urban history.

This is the complete collection of Bruce Springsteen's recorded lyrics, illustrated with hundreds of never-before-published images from some of rock & roll journalism's greatest photographers, including Annie Leibovitz, David Gahr, Lynn Goldsmith, Bruce Weber, and many others. From Jim Marchese's informal backstage shots during the European leg of the 1980 The River tour to Neal Preston's amazing documentation of the Born in the U.S.A. days to Pam Springsteen's portraits showing a side of the musician rarely seen by the public, this is the most intimate look at Bruce Springsteen ever published. The photos and lyrics are accompanied by original commentary by Springsteen, in which he reflects on the songs, the performances, and the quarter-century career that for many defines the American dream. In words and in pictures, here is the one book no Bruce Springsteen fan can afford to be without.
 id : 241391 ISBN : 2070411133  | name : Géopolitique du chaos  |  description : Le rythme précipité et la profondeur des transformations de tous ordres, en cette fin de millénaire, stupéfient. La mondialisation de l'économie bouleverse tout, stimulée par l'accélération des technologies de l'information. Le marché et la communication s'imposent comme modèles généraux ayant vocation à transformer toutes les activités humaines. Etats-nations, gouvernements, partis et syndicats perdent leurs repères traditionnels. Les responsables politiques donnent l'impression de ne pas être à la hauteur, de ne point comprendre qu'ils vivent un radical changement d'ère. Les Etats-Unis, superpuissance unique, doivent désormais compter sur la rivalité des deux autres pôles : l'Europe et l'Asie-Pacifique. Mais ce triptyque triomphant est à son tour défié par les pays émergents, et par le déferlement des haines ethniques, nationalistes et religieuses qui explosent partout. Il doit également faire face à l'effondrement du Sud où vit 80 % de la population du globe. Dans un monde interdépendant, la protection de l'environnement relève également de la haute politique. Quelles réponses globales à des questions cruciales sur la démographie, la techno-science, l'effet de serre, le sous-développement, le système de sécurité ? A quoi ressemble le nouveau paysage planétaire ? Quels Etats, quelles forces, quels nouveaux paradigmes émergent dans ce contexte ? Quel est le système de pensée dominant ? Quelles nouvelles clés pour comprendre la formidable mutation actuelle ? L'envergure des défis ne doit pas nous faire douter du futur.

 id : 241394 ISBN : 2213607060  | name : L'abolition  |  description : Ce livre est le récit d'une longue lutte contre la peine de mort. Il commence au jour de l'exécution de Claude Buffet et de Roger Bontems, le 24 novembre 1972, et s'achève avec le vote de l'abolition, le 30 septembre 1981. Depuis lors, l'abolition s'est étendue à la majorité des Etats dans le monde. Elle est désormais la loi de l'Europe entière. Elle marque un progrès irréversible de l'humanité sur ses peurs, ses angoisses, sa violence. A considérer cependant les exécutions pratiquées aux Etats-Unis, en Chine, en Iran et dans de nombreux autres pays, le combat contre la peine de mort est loin d'être achevé. Puisse l'évocation de ce qui advint en France servir la grande cause de l'abolition universelle. R.B.
 id : 241395 ISBN : 067976349X  | name : The Tetherballs of Bougainville  |  description : From his cult classic, I Smell Esther Williams, to his wildly popular and insightful column "Wild Kingdom" appearing in Esquire magazine every month, Mark Leyner has been giving us up close and personal encounters of the most hilarious kind for over a decade. Now, in his new novel The Tetherballs of Bougainville, Leyner shares with us, long last, the quintessential coming of age story that every writer, at some point, is compelled to tell. In the novel we meet young Mark Leyner, 13-years-old to be exact, as he waits in a New Jersey prison to witness his father's execution. Adolescence is never easy, and it just so happens that this junior high schooler is on deadline to turn in a screenplay for which he has already been awarded the Vincent and Lenore DiGiacomo/Oshimitsu Polymers America Award. And, as it was for all of us during out teenage years, nothing seems to go as planned. Written as autobiography, screenplay and movie review, The Tetherballs of Bougainville twists three familiar narrative forms into an outlandishly compelling story. Leyner's use of the media-driven formats brilliantly reflects our secret, shameful and hilarious desire to experience our private lives as mass entertainment. The Tetherballs of Bougainville skewers and celebrates American pop culture in the late twentieth century. Leyner's version of our lives is so deeply funny because it is so painfully true.

Author Bob Cooper-a former Running Times executive editor, a competitive runner, and a longtime Bay Area resident-scouted each route himself so runners don't have to waste their own time exploring unsuitable or less-than-enjoyable routes.

You are a smart, funny, beautiful Grrl Genius -- just because you say you are. In The Grrl Genius Guide to Life, stand-up comic and Grrl Genius Club founder Cathryn Michon explains why she is a genius and demonstrates how you can become one, too, by following her easy twelve-step program. The first step in the program is the most important: Admit that you are a Grrl Genius. Acknowledge that you are beautiful, intelligent, and talented and that you are the only person in the world who can decide just how great you are. In subsequent steps, you will learn to embrace the domestic arts, love your Grrl Genius good looks, celebrate your sexuality, appreciate your Grrl Genius mother, and pass the Grrl Genius message on to others! Filled with little-known facts about such unacknowledged Grrl Geniuses as Mozart's younger sister Nannerl and Einstein's wife Mileva, as well as hilarious, embarrassing stories from Michon's own life, The Grrl Genius Guide to Life is a must-read for Grrl Geniuses and Enlightened Males everywhere. Michon shares her most humiliating memories -- singing show tunes at her aunt's funeral, crying uncontrollably in an airplane bathroom and holding up the flight -- as well as her moments of triumph, like attending the birth of her niece (a future Grrl Genius) and getting liposuction that not a single human being noticed. This is an uproarious roller-coaster ride through the life of a self-declared Genius -- in which Michon writes about everything from doughnuts to divorce, from physics to push-up bras -- and a comic inspirational guide for those aspiring to Grrl Geniushood. Cathryn Michon is a genius -- just because she says she is. Read her book, and you will become one, too. As with any twelve-step program, becoming a Grrl Genius takes work. All your life you have been telling yourself that your butt is too big, your ideas are too small, and your love for creme-filled doughnuts is inherently evil. With the help of The Grrl Genius Guide to Life, you will learn to recognize your own brilliance, shamelessly proclaim it to the rest of the world, and eat all the Krispy Kreme doughnuts you want. In case you need inspiration, Michon has included numerous Grrl Genius slogans and Little Pink Post-it Notes; in case you get hungry, she has included her recipe for the best chocolate chip cookies in the world. So go on -- take the first step. Read the book that is guaranteed to change your life forever (or at the very least to make you laugh yourself silly) -- and declare your Genius to yourself and the world!

 id : 241453 ISBN : 0642541493  | name : The Edwardians  |  description : This catalogue accompanies the exhibition opening at the National Gallery of Australia in March 2004 that aims to reassess the art of the Edwardian period, focusing in particular on the art of Australia. Among Australia's most loved artists are those who went to Europe at the turn of the 19th century to study and live. Many of them stayed abroad for two decades and, like Australian film stars of today, became absorbed onto the world stage. This book places the work of these artists in the context of the British, Irish and American artists with whom they exhibited and associated, and demonstrates their parallel concerns in painterly approach and subject. Opening with paintings by Whistler, which were so influential on the artists of this period, the exhibition focuses on figurative paintings by select British, Irish, American and Australian artists from 1900 to 1914. It also includes George Lambert's King Edward VII (1910), completed shortly before Edward's death and now held in the Commonwealth of Australia Collection. In total the exhibition comprises approximately 140 paintings, sculptures, costumes and fan designs drawn from national and international collections.

 id : 241562 ISBN : 0807117749  | name : Creole New Orleans  |  description : This collection of six original essays explores the peculiar ethnic composition and history of New Orleans, which the authors persuasively argue is unique among American cities. The focus of Creole New Orleans is on the development of a colonial Franco-African culture in the city, the ways that culture was influenced by the arrival of later immigrants, and the processes that led to the eventual dominance of the Anglo-American community. Essays in the book's first section focus not only on the formation of the curiously blended Franco-African culture but also on how that culture, once established, resisted change and allowed New Orleans to develop along French and African creole lines until the early nineteenth century. Jerah Johnson explores the motives and objectives of Louisiana's French founders, giving that issue the most searching analysis it has yet received. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, in her account of the origins of New Orleans' free black population, offers a new approach to the early history of Africans in colonial Louisiana. The second part of the book focuses on the challenge of incorporating New Orleans into the United States. As Paul F. LaChance points out, the French immigrants who arrived after the Louisiana Purchase slowed the Americanization process by preserving the city's creole culture. Joesph Tregle then presents a clear, concise account of the clash that occurred between white creoles and the many white Americans who during the 1800s migrated to the city. His analysis demonstrates how race finally brought an accommodation between the white creole and American leaders. The third section centers on the evolution of the city's race relations during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Joseph Logsdon and Caryn Cossé Bell begin by tracing the ethno-cultural fault line that divided black Americans and creole through Reconstruction and the emergence of Jim Crow. Arnold R. Hirsch pursues the themes discerned by Logsdon and Bell from the turn of the century to the 1980s, examining the transformation of the city's racial politics. Collectively, these essays fill a major void in Louisiana history while making a significant contribution to the history of urbanization, ethnicity, and race relations. The book will serve as a cornerstone for future study of the history of New Orleans.
 id : 241563 ISBN : 0807118036  | name : Crucible of Reconstruction  |  description : In late April, 1862, Union warships slipped past the Confederate river forts below New Orleans and blasted the Rebel fleet guarding the city. Advancing overland, General Benjamin F. Butler occupied New Orleans on May Day, and for the duration of the war the Stars and Stripes waved over the Confederacy's largest city. The reconstruction of Louisiana began almost immediately. In Crucible of Reconstruction, Ted Tunnell examines the byzantine complexities of Louisiana's restoration to the Union, from the capture of New Orleans to the downfall of the Radical Republicans a decade and a half later. He writes with insight about wartime Reconstruction and the period of presidential Reconstruction under Andrew Johnson, but his ultimate concern is with Radical Reconstruction and that uneasy coalition of Unionists, free blacks, and carpetbaggers that formed the Louisiana Republican party after Appomattox and struggled fitfully for a biracial society based on equality and justice. One of the distinguishing features of Crucible of Reconstruction is its concern with the origins of Radicalism. Tunnell finds that nearly two-thirds of Louisiana Unionists were actually outsiders, men who had come to Louisiana from the North or from abroad. Of the remainder, many had either been born in the border slave states that sided with the North in 1861 or had been deeply influenced by Northern culture. The free blacks were the most radical element of the Republican party and for a brief but critical moment actually dominated the reconstruction process; with a black majority in the constitutional convention of 1867-1868, they drafted a civil rights program that made Louisiana's Reconstruction constitution, along with South Carolina's, a model of Republican Radicalism. In the end, though, the carpetbaggers dominated Republican Reconstruction. Although few in number, they controlled the immense federal bureaucracy centered in New Orleans, and in a government that depended on support from Washington for its very survival, they alone had influence on the Potomac. For a generation historians have struggled to explain the destructive factionalism that crippled the Republican regimes in Louisiana and other Reconstruction states. In a thesis of wide applicability, Tunnel shows how Republican factionalism was actually rooted in a larger "crisis of legitimacy." Louisiana Republicans confronted enemies who challenged not merely their policies but their very right to exist, enemies whose overriding goal was to expunge the Republican party from the polity. Led by Governor Henry Clay Warmoth, a carpetbagger from Illinois, the Republicans responded to the crisis with a twofold strategy embodied in what Tunnell calls the policy of force and the policy of peace. The policy of force, while it partially deterred assaults on Republican voters, undermined northern support for Reconstruction. The policy of peace not only failed to conciliate white Louisianians, it generated the vicious factionalism that destroyed the Republican party from within. The Warmoth strategies were in fact mutually contradictory; they negated each other and demolished his government. In his final chapter, Tunnell recounts the career of Marshall Harvey Twitchell, a Vermont carpetbagger who settled in north Louisiana in 1866. Twitchell's tragic story, gleaned from his unpublished autobiography and government records, provides a stunningly immediate reminder of the violent and unlawful conditions that existed during the final years of Reconstruction in Louisiana. Tunnell's analyses of Unionism, of black and white political leadership, of Republican factionalism, and of the brutal eradication of Republicanism in the state make this one of the most fascinating and provocative of recent books on Reconstruction.

Johnston's exciting trilogy of the rugged trappers and mountain men, Indian fighters, and hardy pioneers who battled for the future of this land--and won. High in the Rockies lay the Bayou Salade, a lush beaver-rich valley so untouched that the few white men who had seen it called it paradise. But for Scratch Bass, his young partner Josiah Paddock, and the two Indian women they loved, this paradise would open up a hell of violence. Pursued by a vengeful Arapaho raiding party, Scratch will lead his small band through a flurry of arrows all the way to Taos itself. Yet the trail of blood will not end there. For in St. Louis an old enemy waits, and the time is ripe for Scratch to settle a ten-year score. Through the desert known as the Journey of Death to the rough-and-tumble town of St. Louis, Scratch and Josiah will defy the wilderness to bury the past--and a blackhearted killer--once and for all.

The year is 1807, and Richard Sharpe is back in England, where his career seems to have come to a dead end. Loveless, destitute, and relegated to the menial tasks of quartermaster, Sharpe roams the streets of London, pondering a bleak future away from the army. Then, out of the blue, an old friend invites him to undertake a secret mission -- the delivery of a bribe -- to the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Denmark is officially neutral, but Napoleon is threatening an invasion in order to capture the powerful Danish fleet, which could replace the ships France lost in its disastrous defeat at Trafalgar. The British, fearing such enhancement of French power, threaten their own preemptive invasion, and Sharpe, whose errand seemed so simple, is trapped in a web of treachery that will end only when the city, which thought itself safe, is subjected to a brutal and merciless bombardment. Sharpe's Prey -- the chronological sequel to Sharpe's Trafalgar -- finds Bernard Cornwell at the top of his bestselling form, combining the meticulous historical detail and fantastic battle scenes he's famous for with a plot that races at breakneck speed toward the final, bloody battle that threatens to destroy Copenhagen.

 id : 241702 ISBN : 3895080659  | name : Werke in fünf Bänden I.  |  description : Heinrich Heine hat das Buch der Lieder, das 1827 zuerst erschien, als sein "Hauptbuch" betrachtet und geplant. In ihm wird das Thema unglücklicher Liebe zum Kristallisationskern der Auseinandersetzung mit der Wirklichkeit. Heine greift vielfach auf überlieferte lyrische Formen und Redeweisen zurück, variiert und kritisiert sie jedoch in dem Bewußtsein, daß die poetisch vermittelte vor der "wirklichen" Welt standhalten muß. Daraus entsteht der eigentümliche "Heine- Ton", der von der Romantik geprägte Lesererwartungen mitunter enttäuscht. Das Buch der Lieder galt auch vielen Zeitgenossen als Heines Hauptbuch, für sie wurde es zum Inbegriff des Lyrischen, und wirklich ist die deutsche Sprache selten so mühelos und klangvoll gehandhabt worden wie in diesen Gedichten. Maßgebend für das Bild, das man sich später vom Lyriker Heine machte, waren ungezählte Vertonungen und zahlreiche populäre Anthologien, die indessen dem "entdornten" Heine den Vorzug gaben. Was für Heines Werk insgesamt gilt, trifft auch auf das Buch der Lieder zu: Es wurde bewundert und verurteilt - nie aber hat es seine Leser gleichgültig gelassen. "Wenn es um Heine ging, wurde in Deutschland seit eh und je scharf geschossen. Ein geborener Provokateur war er und ein ewiger Ruhestörer ... Er ging ins Exil, um nie in Deckung gehen zu müssen. Seine Biographie reicht vom jüdischen Mittelalter bis zur europäischen Neuzeit, sein Werk führt von der deutschen Romantik zur Moderne der Deutschen ... Stets setzte er sich zwischen alle Stühle. Und fast will es scheinen, als sei da immer noch sein Platz. Aber es spricht nicht gegen Heine, dass sein Werk uns immer wieder beunruhigt. Dass es noch ist, was es war: eine Provokation und eine Zumutung." Marcel Reich-Ranicki

 id : 241720 ISBN : 1573927953  | name : The Joy of Self-pleasuring  |  description : Psychiatrist and sex therapist Edward L. Rowan, M.D., has written this unique book to encourage us all to come out of the closet. Masturbation is surely one of the most common human activities, and yet most of us react to the subject with embarrassment. Americans are generally so uncomfortable with the topic that former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was fired for indiscreetly suggesting in public that high school kids masturbate as a way of avoiding HIV infection. Dr. Rowan points to the Elders incident as evidence that we are still victims of a negative cultural attitude spawned by the sin and sickness models of early Church fathers and medical practitioners who did not know any better. Unfortunately, they established a pattern of shame and guilt that is difficult to overcome in spite of our current knowledge. Although masturbation is now recognized as a therapeutic tool in addressing sexual dysfunction and problematic arousal patterns, Rowan argues that it can be much more. Good orgasms, whether alone or with a partner, provide a sense of well-being and personal autonomy. Relationships are better when one does not have to depend solely on a partner to make them whole. Masturbation is also the safest form of safe sex. While masturbation is a universal behavior, there are differences in motivation, frequency, technique, and fantasy patterns between men and women. Rowan discusses these differences while emphasizing that masturbation can be good sex and should be experienced for pleasure not just as a tension release. Our attitudes are due for a change, says Dr. Rowan, and The Joy of Self-Pleasuring is designed to promote that change while offering the reader information, insight, and humor as well.

 id : 241782 ISBN : 0964613727  | name : Memo to All Employees  |  description : MEMO TO ALL EMPLOYEES is the second book of poetry by Daniel X. O'Neil, a nationally-known performance poet based in Chicago. O'Neil bridges the printed gap between the thriving Spoken Word poetry movement & the publishing world. O'Neil draws his immediate, gripping style from the daily newspaper & his use of cultural figures from pop art. His performance moniker is "The Worldwide Entertainment Juggernaut of the 21st Century." Through superior graphic design he reduces a sweeping, grand performance style to the page in an electrifying way. Pre-World War I Futurism has helped shape his poetic mission, which places the poet at the center of society instead of on the freaky, inconsequential fringe. This volume has love poems, narrative portraits, & experiments in the Beat Breath. It also contains a verse drama & a poetic essay on the 1993 government raid on the Koreshians in Waco, Texas. Many poems have "stage directions" which set the tone & open up new levels of meaning. The result is a lively, highly literary, & gigantically entertaining volume of poetry that destroys the concept that poetry is a "tough sell." This book is dedicated to the public library. All book orders are taken directly through Juggernaut, P.O. Box 3824, Chicago, IL 60654-0824, or call 312-907- 8947.
 id : 241786 ISBN : 0060911859  | name : The Courage to Grieve  |  description : This unusual self-help book about surviving grief offers the reader comfort and inspiration. Each of us will face some loss, sorrow and disappointment in our lives, and The Courage to Grieve provides the specific help we need to enable us to face our grief fully and to recover and grow from the experience. Although the book emphasizes the response to the death of a loved one, The Courage to Grieve can help with every kind of loss and grief. Judy Tatelbaum gives us a fresh look at understanding grief, showing us that grief is a natural, inevitable human experience, including all the unexpected, intense and uncomfortable emotions like sorrow, guilt, loneliness, resentment, confusion, or even the temporary loss of the will to live. The emphasis is to clarify and offer help, and the tone is spiritual, optimistic, creative and easy to understand. Judy Tatelbaum provides excellent advice on how to help oneself and others get through the immediate experience of death and the grief that follows, as well as how to understand the special grief of children. Particularly useful are the techniques for completing or "finishing" grief--counteracting the popular misconception that grief never ends. The Courage to Grieve shows us how to live life with the ultimate courage: not fearing death. This book is about so much more than death and grieving it is about life and joy and growth.

Within, seven boys suffer from a deadly disease, one that causes them to fear the open air more than anything else, more than any nightmare any child has ever had. They were told to resign themselves to their fate. They were told that finding a cure would be a miracle. They were told they were never going to leave this place as long as they were alive, and that's what they've always believed-- -- until now. Oliver Taylor is leaving the Complex for the first time in fifteen years. He'll breathe unfiltered air. He'll know the touch of another human being. He'll see the world that was denied him. Through a freak twist of fate, he's gone into total remission. The doctors are baffled by his sudden health, but loathe letting him go for other reasons. Oliver knows too much. He simply can't be allowed to go free. Jake Danziger, government operative for the Agency, a branch of the intelligence network with supreme authority, is assigned to him. His job? Be a father figure to a boy who has never had one-- -- and watch him. Watch him closely. But how is Jake supposed to do that when Oliver keeps disappearing? And people keep dying? And Oliver himself seems unaware of anything other than his incredible intelligence, his strength, his speed-- -- and his memories.

 id : 241869 ISBN : 080327999X  | name : The Game  |  description : On the eve of their wedding, twenty-year-old Jack Fleming arranges a secret ringside seat for his sweetheart to view her only rival: the "game." Through Genevieve's apprehensive eyes, we watch the prizefight that pits her fair young lover, "the Pride of West Oakland," against the savage and brutish John Ponta and that reveals as much about her own nature, and Joe's, as it does about the force that drives the two men in their violent, fateful encounter. ø Responding to a review that took him to task for his realism, Jack London wrote, "I have had these experiences and it was out of these experiences, plus a fairly intimate knowledge of prize-fighting in general, that I wrote The Game." With this intimate realism, London took boxing out of the realm of disreputable topics and set it on a respectable literary course that extends from A. J. Liebling to Ernest Hemingway to Joyce Carol Oates. The familiarity of London's boxing writing testifies to its profound influence on later literary commentators on the sport, while the story The Game tells remains one of the most powerful and evocative portraits ever given of prizefighters in the grip of their passion.

With Glen dead and his unknown killers now after Tom and Scott, they are the ones in serious trouble. Since the police are slow to respond to the danger they are in (in fact, Tom and Scott are under suspicion themselves), they are forced to investigate on their own.

 id : 241898 ISBN : 0688171095  | name : The KGB Bar Book Of Poems  |  description : Started in 1997 by poets David Lehman and Star Black, the KGB Bar poetry series is widely recognized as the hottest and perhaps the best reading series in New York. Located in the hip East Village KGB Bar, these Monday-night readings boast a fantastic variety and quality of internationally known poets from Charles Simic, Molly Peacock, and Katha Pollit to Marie Howe, Mark Strand, and Yusef Komunyakaa. Now Lehman and Black have gathered work from the first three seasons into a wonderful anthology. Together with a generous supply of photographs and anecdotes from contributors on the most memorable thing ever to happen to them at a poetry reading, this unique book of poems reflects the amazing variety and energy of poetry today. The poems range in style from Douglas. Crase's "Astropastoral" ("I have seen you on every horizon, how you are stored/And encouraged and brought to the brim/Until the round bounds of one planet could not hold you in") to Anne Porter's "Five Wishes." Offering a wide window into contemporary poetry, The KGB Bar Book of Poems debunks the myth of poetry's ivory tower to reveal the kind of raw, candid reading experience that truly brings poetry to life. "The pre-Russian revolutionary locale gives the gathering a committed, not to say conspiratorial air, and it somehow manages to foster a true sense of camaraderie, experimentation, and open exchange between readers and audience. I've seldom enjoyed an evening of poetry and friendship more."--Jonathan Galassi (President of The Academy of American Poets), the KGB Bar poetry series Every Monday night, the KGB Bar's poetry readings are packed to overflowing. Pulitzer Prize winners bum cigarettes from grad students and martini glasses are refilled between readings, while the best poets in the country share their latest work with a rapt audience. The KGB Bar is the sexiest and arguably the best venue for poetry in New York City, and now The KGB Bar Book of Poems brings this hot literary series to the page. Icons like John Ashbery and Charles Wright appear here with other favorites such as Molly Peacock and Katha Pollitt. Many of the poets have also written anecdotes about their own most memorable poetry readings. With dynamic black-and-white photographs throughout, The KGB Bar Book of Poems reflects the dazzling variety and tremendous energy of poetry today.

 id : 241915 ISBN : 1587212781  | name : Thundermaker  |  description : How is it possible that the most valued painting in history, the Mona Lisa, could have been stolen, destroyed and reconstructed in this erotic adventure? The answer is here in an international exposé you'll want to read several times over so as to enjoy Stan Stanton at his cleverest. He lays before you his cool approach to a challenge and illustrates his analytical resolution. The resolution he arrives at is hidden under a blanket of intrigue, sexual opportunity and humor. As private insurance investigators, hired by Lloyds Insurance of London, Stan Stanton and his loveable partner, Sandra Hawkins, are asked to determine the validity of a double indemnity claim in the little village of Donlorning Place, Scotland. Little do they realize that the case would evolve around extremists willing to commit murder for their ideals of freedom. As part of a unique plan for an exorbitant ransom, the radicals, led by Ben Maheny, steal the Mona Lisa while it's en route to the Tate Britain Gallery on loan. Unfortunate for all concerned, the radicals accidentally destroyed the painting in an explosion. Stanton, as a representative of Scotland Yard, along with a high ranking staff member at Lloyds, offer theft condolences and try to soothe Monsieur Jean-Louis, curator at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. After endless threats, barely short of an international war, the curator drops Stan into the hands of his breath-taking assistant Mimi de Margot. As her responsibility, Stan tours the museum, has a fabulous night of dinner and dancing, closes the evening in her apartment. But the plot thickens when Stan returns to London and uncovers strange clues that tie the death in Donlorning Place to the stealing of the Mona Lisa painting. With the help of Colonel Banister's secret agents at Scotland Yard, Stan and Sandra subdue Ben Maheny and his extremists group, and expose the Louvre curator as an art world fraud who sent a fake painting to Britain, for personal and monetary gains.

William falls back in time to when he and his brother Joseph visited the farm for the last time, where he faces the one ghost that has haunted him for the last 20 years. In Final Harvest, William's grandfather, James Cooper, tells the story of how he met his wife Elizabeth. He recalls his wandering youth, his search for a home, his search for love and the fragility of that love once found. "For he knew how the promises we make at night in our lover's embrace shine like bright stars and angel's eyes, but he was also aware how daylight can steal them away from our lips, come morning."
 id : 241932 ISBN : 0786888679  | name : The Teammates  |  description : Now in paperback, the New York Times bestselling The Teammates -- David Halberstam's stirring tribute to the golden age of baseball and to friendship. The Teammates is the profoundly moving story of four great baseball players who have made the passage from sports icons -- when they were young and seemingly indestructible -- to men dealing with the vulnerabilities of growing older. At the core of the book is the friendship of these four very different men -- Boston Red Sox teammates Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Ted Williams -- who remained close for more than sixty years. The book starts out in early October 2001, when Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky begin a 1,300-mile trip by car to visit their beloved friend Ted Williams, whom they know is dying. Bobby Doerr, the fourth member of this close group -- "my guys," Williams used to call them -- is unable to join them. Doerr is back in Oregon tending to his wife of sixty-three years, who has suffered a second stroke. Acclaimed author David Halberstam has given us a book -- filled with historical details and first-hand accounts -- about baseball and about something more, the richness of friendship.

Rick Marin offers himself up for an in-depth look at man's superficial nature. At 28, a brief, doomed first marriage thrusts Marin back into Bachelor Hell. A journalist as eager to make it in Manhattan as with its female population, our emotionally myopic hero can never seem to tell if the woman in front of him is too crazy or too sane, until she gets too close. Falling out of love as often as he falls in, he vows more than once to clean up his act, only to relapse into another bender of beauties, blow-offs, and bad behavior -- all in desperate pursuit of the woman who can redeem him. In this rollicking, frequently insensitive and ultimately poignant memoir, Marin proves a master of the light touch even in his darkest hours. It is one man's story, but many men will read it as their own. And for any woman who has ever wondered, "What was he thinking" This is what he was thinking.

Shell spend a week in their studios, interviewing everybody from the weather girl, the junior researchers, the cleaners and make-up artists, to the producers and presenters of the show, piecing together a comprehensive, behind-the-scenes look at exactly what goes on. Liz Fenton, Features Editor, initially sees this as an opportunity to give the TV station some good press coverage.

As Daphne becomes more and more embroiled in life at Daybreak, she finds the thought of the dirt-dishing expose shes been sent to put together more and more unappealing. And when she finds out what the Herald has in store for their much-publicised star guest of the week, it begins to look worse and worse. Can anything be done before the deadline looms?

In Ambling Into History, Bruni paints the most thorough, balanced, eloquent and lively portrait yet of a man in many ways illsuited to the office he sought and won, focusing on small moments that often escaped the news media's notice.

 id : 242090 ISBN : 0465090737  | name : Not To People Like Us Hidden Abuse In Upscale Marriages  |  description : How is it possible for a highly educated woman with a career and resources of her own to stay in a marriage with an abusive husband? How can a man be considered a pillar of his community, run a successful business, yet regularly give his wife a black eye? The very nature of these questions proves our unarticulated assumption that domestic violence is restricted to the lower classes. When we do hear stories of high-profile victims, we regard them as exceptional cases and still believe abuse doesn't happen to "people like us." Now Susan Weitzman counters this assumption by exploring a heretofore overlooked population of battered wives-the well-educated, upper-income women who rarely report abuse and remain trapped by their own silence.With keen insight and sensitivity, Weitzman, a psychotherapist and educator, traces common patterns of behavior among this group-their internal dilemmas and decisions, their dangerous desire to cover up abuse and maintain appearances. She shows how their abusive relationships follow a different course from those in other socioeconomic groups, and how these distinctions have profound implications for understanding the true nature of this behavior. Delving into the stories of these women-wives of CEOs and attorneys, of physicians and professors, the women often professionals themselves-Weitzman builds harrowing psychological profiles of both the abused and the abuser.

 id : 242138 ISBN : 0679449876  | name : Tender at the Bone  |  description : For better or worse, almost all of us grow up at the table. It is in this setting that Ruth Reichl's brilliantly written memoir takes its form. For, at a very early age, Reichl discovered that "food could be a way of making sense of the world . . . if you watched people as they ate, you could find out who they were." Tender at the Bone is the story of a life determined, enhanced, and defined in equal measure by unforgettable people, the love of tales well told, and a passion for food. In other words, the stuff of the best literature. The journey begins with Reichl's mother, the notorious food-poisoner known for-evermore as the Queen of Mold, and moves on to the fabled Mrs. Peavey, onetime Baltimore socialite millionaress, who, for a brief but poignant moment, was retained as the Reichls' maid. Then we are introduced to Monsieur du Croix, the gourmand, who so understood and yet was awed by this prodigious child at his dinner table that when he introduced Ruth to the souffle, he could only exclaim, "What a pleasure to watch a child eat her first souffle!" Then, fast-forward to the politically correct table set in Berkeley in the 1970s, and the food revolution that Ruth watched and participated in as organic became the norm. But this sampling doesn't do this character-rich book justice. After all, this is just a taste. Tender at the Bone is a remembrance of Ruth Reichl's childhood into young adulthood, redolent with the atmosphere, good humor, and angst of a sensualist coming-of-age.

But for the young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, vagabond and thief, Venice is simply home. They have no idea that they stand at the center of the city's coming struggle for its very life. They know nothing of the powerful forces moving in the background. They have barely heard of Chernobog, demonlord of the North, who is shifting his pawns to attack Venice in order to cut into the underbelly of the Holy Roman Empire. All Marco and Benito know is that they're hungry and in dangerous company: Katerina the smuggler, Caesare the sell-sword, Montagnard assassins, church inquisitors, militant Knights of the Holy Trinity, Dottore Marina the Strega mage ...and Maria. Maria might be an honest canaler, but she had the hottest temper a boy could find. Yet among the dark waters of the canals lurk far worse dangers than a hot-tempered girl. Chernobog has set a monster loose to wreak havoc on the city. Magic, murder and evil are all at work to pull Venice down. Fanatical monks seek to root out true witchcraft with fire and sword. Steel-clad Teutonic knights, wealth traders, church dignitaries and great Princes fight and plot for control of the jewel of the Mediterranean. And somehow all of these, from thieves to mages to princes, must gather around Marco and his brother Benito, under the shadow of the great winged lion of Venice.

The Allies have punished Germany for its war crimes by forcing it to revert to a preindustrial age: power stations, railways, factories, and all the machinery of technology have been destroyed or abandoned and left to decay. Moor is a small quarry town (Mauthausen in the all-too-recent past of real history). The occupying American army has installed a camp survivor, Ambras, to govern the local population. Brave, lonely, hated and feared by his former persecutors, Ambras has returned to Moor only because his Jewish wife died there. Setting up house in a derelict villa surrounded by wild hounds that earn him the nickname the Dog King, he chooses another loner, the village boy Bering, as his bodyguard. Moving away from his family and into the compound, the boy enters a new universe of power, of half-glimpsed ideas, of contact with the forbidden world outside. And he meets the only other person Ambras welcomes, a strange and beautiful orphan girl named Lily who lives and hunts in the hills, who knows where the weapons are hidden and forages in the "free world for the goods the villagers crave. But Bering's new life begins to unravel as he succumbs to a strange eye disease known as Morbus Kitahara, in which the vision gradually darkens and which tends to afflict marksmen and sharpshooters. Only Lily can find help, can offer them all a possible future. The three make a courageous bid to escape, and the account of their flight brings the novel to its extraordinarily gripping and suspenseful climax. Searingly powerful, with a poetic intensity that stays with the reader long after the last page, The Dog King is a modern masterpiece.

As Raymond Carney discusses in his introduction, Adams' freeedom from the European traditions of study lends an exuberanceand puckish witto his writings.

De ces belles promenades dans le parc, nous ne rapportions plus l'odeur du tabac fumé en cachette, mais le parfum des petites Américaines. Etait-ce le géranium ou le réséda ?

 id : 242438 ISBN : 0385312709  | name : Pictures of Perfection  |  description : High in the Mid-Yorkshire dales stands the village of Enscombe, pretty as a picture and proud survivor of all that history and nature have been able to throw at it. But now market forces mass at the gates, developers undermine The Green, the walls of the hall have been breached by tourists, an estate agent's blazon flies over the vicarage, and the school is making its last desperate stand. Against these crimes the law offers little defense. But when a policeman is reported missing, leaving only a handful of bizarre clues, DCI Peter Pascoe gets worried. Detective Superintendent Andrew Dalziel thinks he's just overreacting - until the normally phlegmatic Sergeant Wield also shows signs of changing his first impressions of village life. Over two eventful days a new pattern emerges, of lust and lying, of family feuds and ancient injuries, of frustrated desires and unbalanced minds. Finally, inevitably, everything comes to a bloody climax at the Squire's Reckoning, where the villagers gather each Lady Day to feast and gossip and pay old debts. Not even the presence of the Mid-Yorkshire CID trio can change the course of history, though one of them is to find the course of his own personal history changed forever.

Estudió en Alemania, y trabajó en la banca, en su ciudad natal. La primera edición de «La conciencia de Zeno» (1923) tuvo que pagarla el mismo Svevo, y de hecho la fama no le alcanzó hasta después de su muerte. Esta novela revela en parte la seducción por las doctrinas de Freud, pero fundamentalmente es una cala irónica y autobiográfica en la condición del hombre. Joyce (a la sazón en Trieste) saludó con alegría su aparición, y contribuyó a su difusión fuera de Italia.

Cousins's story is inspirational reading for anyone contending with a serious illness.

Il s'est battu avec un élan dont je ne le croyais plus capable, il a essayé de la retenir jusqu'au bout. Je me souviens encore de sa fureur et de son désarroi quand il se sentit frôlé par l'aile de l'ange. Je me souviens aussi de sa terreur, dans la crypte. Pourtant. Pendant un moment, j'y ai cru. J'ai cru au miracle du verbe, Et je l'ai vue, elle qui était au bord du monde, je l'ai vue lui caresser la poitrine en disant qu'elle était à lui pour toujours. Elle avait, comme cela, des gestes de joie timide. Et l'on chantait le Magnificat. Et l'on avait tort. Car la musique elle-même a été bafouée. J'aurais dû intervenir, moi qui savais qu'il y a des offenses qu'on ne peut pardonner. J'aurais dû empêcher cette horreur. Mais je n'avais plus de force. En fait, tout avait commencé un an plus tôt. Avec l'audace et l'intensité d'une écriture classique, L'Offense dit l'échec de la parole et l'amour interdit des corps.

This is a land of energetic colliding egos, of modern media clashing with ancient cultures, of broken sexual boundaries." --New York Newsday "HIS MOST DARING AND MOST VIBRANT NOVEL...The story of circus-as-India is told with gusto and delightful irreverence." --Bharati Mukherjee The Washington Post Book World "Ringmaster Irving introduces act after act, until three (or more) rings are awhirl at a lunatic pace....[He] spills characters from his imagination as agilely as improbable numbers of clowns pile out of a tiny car....His Bombay and his Indian characters are vibrant and convincing." --The Wall Street Journal "IRRESISTIBLE...POWERFUL...Irving's gift for dialogue shines." --Chicago Tribune

Telle est aussi l'écriture de Marc Villard, poète, nouvelliste et romancier qui aborde ici un genre rare et périlleux : la nouvelle à caractère autobiographique, à travers une succession de clichés pris sur le vif - le vif du sujet bien entendu. Il en naît un personnage, l'auteur, un peu à la manière dont Woody Allen se met en scène. Car ces nouvelles sont souvent drôles, voire burlesques - l'homme n'est pas de ceux qui ménagent leur personnage -, parfois discrètement pathétiques. Avec cette vivacité, cette acidité qui caractérisent celui dont on a dit qu'il manie la plus belle plume du roman noir français.

 id : 242545 ISBN : 0521400643  | name : Dante: De Vulgari Eloquentia  |  description : De vulgari eloquentia, written by Dante in the early years of the fourteenth century, is the only known work of medieval literary theory to have been produced by a practising poet, and the first to assert the intrinsic superiority of living, vernacular languages over Latin. Its opening consideration of language as a sign-system includes foreshadowings of twentieth-century semiotics, and later sections contain the first serious effort at literary criticism based on close analytical reading since the classical era. Steven Botterill here offers an accurate Latin text and a readable English translation of the treatise, together with notes and introductory material, thus making available a work which is relevant not only to Dante's poetry and the history of Italian literature, but to our whole understanding of late medieval poetics, linguistics, and literary practice.

 id : 242548 ISBN : 3822858765  | name : Auguste Renoir  |  description : Renoir's timelessly charming paintings are the embodiment of happiness, love, & beauty; it is no doubt because of this that he is the most popular of the impressionists. TASCHEN's Renoir, the most complete retrospective book of this painter's work, examines in detail the history & motivation behind the legend. Renoir was incredibly prolific, painting over 5000 works during his lifetime, though many of these were studies. For this monograph, we have chosen 600 of his masterpleces that best demonstrate his immense talent & historical importance. Gilles Neret's detailed, insightful text traces the evolution of Renoir (1841-1919) from young porcelain decorator to one of the most famous painters of his generation, including his abandonment of landscapes in favor of portraiture & his final attraction, after years of success, to painting what he loved most, the Washers descending from the Olympia & his model & servant, Gabrielle, painted as a goddess. With a complete chronology, bibliography, & index of works, as well as photos & sketches illustrating Renoir's life & work, TASCHEN's Renoir is the essential reference book for this painter of happiness & poet of love. Oh, & did we mention the gorgeous, large-format color reproductions?
 id : 242549 ISBN : 0674008758  | name : PUBLIC VOWS  |  description : We commonly think of marriage as a private matter between two people, a personal expression of love and commitment. In this pioneering history, Nancy F. Cott demonstrates that marriage is and always has been a public institution. From the founding of the United States to the present day, imperatives about the necessity of marriage and its proper form have been deeply embedded in national policy, law, and political rhetoric. Legislators and judges have envisioned and enforced their preferred model of consensual, lifelong monogamy--a model derived from Christian tenets and the English common law that posits the husband as provider and the wife as dependent.In early confrontations with Native Americans, emancipated slaves, Mormon polygamists, and immigrant spouses, through the invention of the New Deal, federal income tax, and welfare programs, the federal government consistently influenced the shape of marriages. And even the immense social and legal changes of the last third of the twentieth century have not unraveled official reliance on marriage as a "pillar of the state." By excluding some kinds of marriages and encouraging others, marital policies have helped to sculpt the nation's citizenry, as well as its moral and social standards, and have directly affected national understandings of gender roles and racial difference.

 id : 242685 ISBN : 3895084573  | name : The Scarlet Letter  |  description : "'Thou and thine, Hester Prynne, belong to me.' With these chilling words a husband claims his wife after a two-year absence. But the child she clutches is not his, and Hester must wear a scarlet 'A' upon her breast, the sin of adultery visible to all. Under an assumed name her husband begins his search for her lover, determined to expose what Hester is equally determined to protect. Defiant and proud, Hester witnesses the degradation of two very different men, as moral codes and legal imperatives painfully collide." "Set in the Puritan community of seventeenth-century Boston, The Scarlet Letter also sheds light on the nineteenth century in which it was written, as Hawthorne explores his ambivalent relations with his Puritan forebears. The text of this edition is taken from the Centenary Edition of Hawthorne's works, the most authoritative critical edition."--BOOK JACKET.

Now she turns her wickedly perceptive eye to the residents of Philadelphia's posh Main Line district, the legendary land of the rich and well-to-do, where the wealthy live their very private lives--and occasionally commit very scandalous crimes. Aristocratic Philadelphia natives may think the bluest blood in America flows through their veins, but sometimes outsiders with large fortunes can buy their way into this privileged company--and glamorous newcomers Neddy and Tea Roederer have wealth aplenty. For English teacher Amanda Pepper, the champagne gala on behalf of Philly Prep's library is a night to remember. After all, it is her introduction to ultra-rich society--an evening so extravagant that nothing can tarnish the party . . . not even a group of protesters outside burning the host in effigy. But Amanda senses deeper trouble, and her intuition is right on target. The Moral Ecologists, who vehemently feel that "reading pollutes the mind," will do anything to advance their agenda. And Amanda's new affluent acquaintances prove to be just as deceitful and violent--as she learns firsthand that the bluest blood bleeds just as red. Especially with murder. With her customary bons mots, elegant prose, and storytelling prowess, Gillian Roberts upholds her enviable reputation as "the Dorothy Parker of mystery writers . . . giving more wit per page than most writers give per book." * * Nancy Pickard

The novel consists of 12 chapters, each with a date, either a specific date (i.e. day, month, year) or a more general date (i.e. year or range of years). We actually start off with 1919, i.e. after World War I. Three women and a young boy are travelling around ruined France, looking for something. Simon gives a wonderful picture of France just after World War I, a country in ruins, completely devastated with few facilities and transport networks destroyed. We soon learn that the group consists of a widow, her sisters-in-law and the widow's son. They are looking for the grave of the widow's late husband, killed in the war. The young boy is Simon himself, with his mother and his aunts, who actually did go looking for the grave of Simon's father (this was confirmed by Simon in an interview with Marianne Alphant, a journalist for La Libération). They find the grave from a description they have been given.

In this book of "trialogues," the late psychedelic visionary and shamanologist Terence McKenna, acclaimed biologist and originator of the morphogenetic fields theory Rupert Sheldrake, and mathematician and chaos theory scientist Ralph Abraham explore the relationships between chaos and creativity and their connection to cosmic consciousness. Their observations call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life in the universe. The authors challenge the reader to the deepest levels of thought with wide-ranging investigations of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos in the dynamics of human creation, and the resacralization of the world. Among the provocative questions the authors raise are: Is Armageddon a self-fulfilling prophecy? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined? Are the eternal laws of nature still evolving? What is the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness?

Designed to echo the inviting look of How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci, and structured to help readers focus on each of the seven genius principles, The How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci Workbook is a companion volume that truly complements and enhances the reader's experience of the original book on which it's based.

 id : 242928 ISBN : 0375508317  | name : What Makes Sammy Run?  |  description : What Makes Sammy Run? Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times--from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York's East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic--his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick's real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. Tothis group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.

 id : 242955 ISBN : 1593080786  | name : Pygmalion and Three Other Plays  |  description : Pygmalion and Three Other Plays, by George Bernard Shaw, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from todays top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the readers viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each readers understanding of these enduring works. Hailed as "a Tolstoy with jokes" by one critic, George Bernard Shaw was the most significant British playwright since the seventeenth century. Pygmalion persists as his best-loved play, one made into both a classic film--which won Shaw an Academy Award for best screenplay--and the perennially popular musical My Fair Lady. Pygmalion follows the adventures of phonetics professor Henry Higgins as he attempts to transform cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a refined lady. The scene in which Eliza appears in high society with the correct accent but no notion of polite conversation is considered one of the funniest in English drama. Like most of Shaw's work, Pygmalion wins over audiences with wit, a taut morality, and an innate understanding of human relationships. This volume also includes Major Barbara, which attacks both capitalism and charitable organizations, The Doctor's Dilemma, a keen-eyed examination of medical morals and malpractice, and Heartbreak House, which exposes the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the bloodshed of World War I. John A. Bertolini is Ellis Professor of the Liberal Arts at Middlebury College, where he teaches dramatic literature, Shakespeare, and film. He has written The Playwrighting Self of Bernard Shaw and articles on Hitchcock, and British and American dramatists. Bertolini also wrote the introduction and notes to the Barnes & Noble Classics edition of Shaw's Man and Superman and Three Other Plays.

Finally, she has found what she never knew she was looking for: a soapbox on which to stand, a mighty sword to release her from the bonds of mediocrity: Holistic Advertising (HA)a recently made-up ancient tradition.

 id : 243101 ISBN : 0140162054  | name : Up the Junction  |  description : Nell Dunn's scenes of London life, as it was lived in the early Sixties in the industrial slums of Battersea, have few parallels in contemporary writing. The exuberant, uninhibited, disparate world she found in the tired old streets and under the railway arches is recaptured in these closely linked sketches; and the result is pure alchemy. In the space of 120 perfect pages, we witness clip-joint hustles, petty thieving, candid sexual encounters, casual birth and casual death. She has a superb gift for capturing colloquial speech and the characters observed in these pages convey that caustic, ironic, and compassionate feeling for life, in which a turn of phrase frequently contains startling flashes of poetry. Battersea, that teeming wasteland of brick south of the Thames, has found its poet in Nell Dunn and Up the Junction is her touchingly truthful and timeless testimonial to it. Copyright © Libri GmbH.

 id : 243124 ISBN : 0553108646  | name : First Evidence  |  description : From the "New York Times bestselling author of Balefire comes a chilling tale of murder, forensic detection, and vivid speculation, pitting a unique crime scene investigator against a culprit who may be unlike any this world ever spawned.... As an experienced crime scene investigator, Colin Cellars has had to contend with missing evidence before. But never has he encountered such a chaotic crime scene as the one at a remote cabin nestled in the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest--site of a reported shoot-out. Cellars cannot find a trace of perpetrator or victim. He can't even confirm there has been a murder, much less that the cabin's owner--and the presumed victim--could be his long-estranged former best friend. But something violent and inexplicable has happened, and each time he approaches the scene seeking clearer evidence, eerie occurrences confound the case further. Cellars is determined to unravel the contradictions, enlisting his closest friends to aid him. As attempts to block his investigation become increasingly vicious, Cellars realizes his life--and those of his friends--are at risk. There's far more at stake here, he's certain, than murder. Someone--something?--will stop at nothing to prevent him from discovering the truth. For the truth is not "out there"--it is locked away in Cellars's own evidence file. But it will do him no good unless he has the vision to see what it really means...before it's too late. Ken Goddard infuses his high-voltage narrative with the depth and authentic detail that only a crime scene expert can. In this riveting thriller, he takes the reader step-by-step through a forensic investigation--and straight into the terrifying heart ofthe unknown.

Far below him in the gaping crowd stands his wife, Anna, to whom he has made a solemn promise: This wire walk will end his career. In this daring moment, Steven Galloway opens his riveting novel about Salvo Ursari, whose life begins in 1919 amid a Transylvanian boyhood inhabited by gypsy folklore and inspired by the bravery of his persecuted people. Salvo's story moves irresistibly from a tragic fire that envelops his family, to street life in Budapest, where he learns the skills of a wire walker, to the carnivals of Europe and the competitive world of the American circus. Most fulfilled when living with paradox, Salvo feels safest while performing startling feats of balance on a wire high above the dangerous world; and most endangered if performing above a net. With compassion, warmth, and blazing originality, Ascension combines jaw-dropping storytelling, and fantastical symbolism with mesmerizing detail of Romany and circus culture, and an unforgettable walk with the amazing Salvo Ursari.

Bound to be an invaluable resource for discussions of traditional and contemporary African cultures, Boy-Wives and Female-Husbands is a book whose time has clearly come.

 id : 243368 ISBN : 0310246083  | name : Case for Christ Student Ed Padded  |  description : Who Was Jesus? A good man? A lunatic? God? There's little question that he actually lived. But miracles? Rising from the dead? Some of the stories you hear about him sound like just that--stories. A reasonable person would never believe them, let alone the claim that he's the only way to God! But a reasonable person would also make sure that he or she understood the facts before jumping to conclusions. That's why Lee Strobel--an award-winning legal journalist with a knack for asking tough questions--decided to investigate Jesus for himself. An atheist, Strobel felt certain his findings would bring Christianity's claims about Jesus tumbling down like a house of cards. He was in for the surprise of his life. Join him as he retraces his journey from skepticism to faith. You'll consult expert testimony as you sift through the truths that history, science, psychiatry, literature, and religion reveal. Like Strobel, you'll be amazed at the evidence--how much there is, how strong it is, and what it says. The facts are in. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?

 id : 243370 ISBN : 0060297107  | name : Jerry Garcia's Amazing Grace  |  description : February of 1993, Jerry Garcia met with David Grisman and Tony Rice to have an acoustic jam session. Tony's wife asked Jerry to sing Amazing Grace, and he obliged, with Grisman on mandolin and Rice on guitar. Together, the three played one of the most hauntingly poignant versions ever recorded of this classic song. Undoubtedly saved by his own "amazing grace," John Newton was a slave ship captain turned preacher who wrote the first version of this timeless hymn in the late 1760s. It went on to become one of the most beloved songs in America. Recorded hundreds of times, it resonates as strongly today as it did when it was originally written. Garcia recorded Amazing Grace for the first time while jamming with Grisman and Rice (recorded on Acoustic Disc's The Pizza Tapes), making it a rare event -- and the inspiration for this book. Jerry Garcia was an artist, a poet, and a world-renowned musician. "Amazing Grace" is a classic song that has inspired countless generations. Here for the first time, the lyrics of this song are illustrated with a selection of Jerry Garcia's own wildly imaginative artwork, which was painstakingly chosen in cooperation with Deborah Koons Garcia from more than four hundred pieces of her late husband's works. A CD of the 1993 Garcia/Grisman/Rice recording of Amazing Grace is included in this book, making Jerry Garcia's Amazing Grace a unique keepsake for art and music lovers alike.

Already a bestselling author, Stephen Law takes a look at such things as the virgin birth (David Hume's theories on miracles), Bertrand Russell's turkey, the existential angst of Santa, and peace on earth to produce a humourous, varied and thought-provoking collection.

 id : 243442 ISBN : 1551521377  | name : What Right?  |  description : Little Sister's Book & Art Emporium, Vancouver's legendary gay and lesbian bookstore, has long fought for freedom of expression, to the point of taking Canada Customs to court, charging that, by regularly seizing materials destined for the store (branding them "obscene"), the federal agency was guilty of harrassment and infringement of free speech. In December of 2000, the Supreme Court of Canada handed down a landmark decision in the case of Little Sister's Book & Art Emporium vs. Canada, stating that the onus of proving that expressive material is obscene lies with Canada Customs. Little Sister's battle against censorship continues, as they recently filed an appeal against Canada Customs for prohibiting the importation of two adult comic books in the Meatmen series. It is the belief of the owners and staff of Little Sister's that the comic books at issue have unquestionable artistic merit, and therefore do not fit the definition of obscenity. The comic books are anthologies of works by both prominent and up-and-coming gay artists. Some claim that comic art is not "artistic" but this is not a belief held by Arsenal Pulp Press. And so, we are pleased to announce the publication of two collections of comic art, by renowned and newer artists, dealing with the issue of censorship, with proceeds being donated to the Little Sister's Defence Fund to assist in their legal challenge to the actions of Canada Customs. The two volumes of What Right? are graphic interpretations of what it means to live in a society where we presumably enjoy the right to free speech, and what happens when, as often happens, that right is challenged. The first collection, subtitled Graphic Interpretations Against Censorship, includes comic art that confronts the serious issues around the denial of civil rights and freedom of speech in particular. The second collection, What's Wrong? subtitled Explicit Graphic Interpretations Against Censorship, includes comic art, often satirical, that epitomizes the kinds of materials that Canada Customs seems intent on censoring, by refusing to allow such materials into the hands of Canadian citizens. The two books in the What Right? series are fundraising projects for the Little Sister's Defence Fund. Arsenal Pulp Press is donating all proceeds over and above its production costs, and all individuals involved have donated their time, energy, and creative talents, to create two marvelous collections of engaging comic art. Each book includes an introduction by Mark Macdonald, author and buyer for Little Sister's Book & Art Emporium.

 id : 243513 ISBN : 0892366583  | name : Seeing Venice  |  description : Bernardo Bellotto's magnificent View of the Grand Canal provides a rich visual record of life in eighteenth-century Venice.

Together, Bellotto's painting and Doty's prose make for an unforgettable encounter with the art and life of Venice.
 id : 243518 ISBN : 069101115X  | name : Unnatural Doubts  |  description : In Unnatural Doubts, Michael Williams constructs a masterly polemic against the very idea of epistemology, as traditionally conceived. Although philosophers have often found problems in efforts to study the nature and limits of human knowledge, Williams provides the first book that systematically argues against there being such a thing as knowledge of the external world. He maintains that knowledge of the world consitutes a theoretically coherent kind of knowledge, whose possibility needs to be defended, only given a deeply problematic doctrine he calls "epistemological realism." The only alternative to epistemological realism is a thoroughgoing contextualism.

 id : 243526 ISBN : 041508248X  | name : The Politics and Poetics of Camp  |  description : The Politics and Poetics of Camp is a radical reappraisal of the meaning and discourse of camp. The contributors look at both the meaning and the uses of camp performance, and ask: is camp a style, or a witty but nonetheless powerful cultural critique? The essays investigate camp from its early formations in the seventeenth and eighteenth century to its present manifestations in queer theatre and literature. They also take a fascinating look at the complex relationship between queer discourse and decidedly un-queer pop culture appropriations on film and on the stage. The Politics and Poetics of Camp is an incisive, uncontainable and entertaining collection of essays by some of the foremost critics working in queer theory, from a number of disciplinary perspectives. This book makes a well-timed intervention into an emerging debate.

 id : 243532 ISBN : 0805745343  | name : A Road to Stonewall  |  description : Since the June 1969 uprising at New York's Stonewall Inn, the very word "Stonewall" has become etched in the American psyche as a synonym for "liberation". Stonewall proved a cataclysmic marker in the lives of gay men and lesbians: it was the point after which gay people were no longer content to live in fearful silence as their most basic rights were trampled on or ignored. Stonewall happened because homosexuals of all races revolted against an act of official oppression. It was indeed a beginning, but it was also the culmination of a long struggle against the tyranny of socially regulated and defined speech about homosexuality. In this insightful and engaging analysis, Byrne R. S. Fone maps out one very significant road to Stonewall - the literary course of male homoerotic desire and the homophobia that has made so much of what homosexuals have written so passionate and moving. Most of the texts Fone analyzes presume that sexuality is the central aspect of identity. Whereas gay literature since 1969 has been a vocal and supporting partner to the activism that has characterized the movement for lesbian and gay rights, before 1969 there were few political initiatives and only a handful of organized groups: the text was dominant.

 id : 243542 ISBN : 0262610418  | name : Inversions  |  description : Backword by Jef Raskin "Inversions" are words that read the same upside down or in a mirror. Or words cleverly hidden inside other words. Each has something to fool the eye, a special visual trick; at the same time the words Kim has chosen to illustrate in this imaginative catalog of challenging visual wordplay reflect the idea of symmetry, both in art and in science. Sixty pages of images portray short and long words, words describing symmetries, variations on Godel, Escher, Bach and on calligraphic themes, and contemporary, historical, and personal names. They are followed by an illustrated text that explores the skills that go into making inversions: symmetry, vision, and letterforms; processes and examples; and associations with music, wordplay, and art. The book is designed so that the text is also symmetrical - what is said in the lefthand column of a page frequently matches the meaning of what is said in the righthand column. Scott Kim is a PhD. candidate in computer science and graphic design at Stanford University.

 id : 243561 ISBN : 0525941754  | name : Memories of My Ghost Brother  |  description : This autobiographical novel explores the coming of age of an Amerasian boy in Korea, torn between his mother's world - haunted by the specter of Japanese occupations and ruled by the imperatives of the spirit kingdom - and his father's transplanted America, the local U.S. army base where G.I.s are preparing for combat in another Asian nation, Vietnam. Young Insu grows up in the chaotic streets of Pupyong, among black marketeers, prostitutes, and castoff biracial children. Death comes daily to Pupyong - through cholera, murder, fatal accidents that are either sad or suspicious - and touches Insu's life directly when his beloved aunt commits suicide after being cruelly spurned by her G.I. lover, and his friend James is found drowned in a drain and neighborhood gossips accuse James's mother, whose pursuit of a new blond husband would have been hampered by a half-black son. Although life on the streets is brutal, and the American school Insu attends no better, his Korean family provides him with love and the nourishment of stories and laughter. Like his mother, Insu is attuned to the world of spirits, and he is haunted by the ghost figure of a young boy, a secret half-brother. When Insu learns the true identity of his ghost brother, he also makes a painful discovery about the corrosive prejudices that have torn his family apart.

 id : 243565 ISBN : 157027021X  | name : Format and Anxiety  |  description : Paul Goodman, anarchist critic and author of Growing Up Absurd and Communitas, never wrote a book devoted exclusively to media. Yet he thought the condition of popular arts and news services in America so desperate that by 1964 he was calling it a constitutional crisisby which he meant that our democracy could no longer claim to be based in the public mores or have its justification in the public good, because of the usurpation of every forum by centralized media overseers. Inevitably, then, most of his books raised fundamental questions about the political and cultural effects of the media while addressing his primary concernseducation, psychotherapy, language theory, literary criticism, community planning, and his decentralist program for the New Left. In Format & Anxiety, Taylor Stoehr has assembled a full and coherent view of Goodmans attitudes toward TV, cinema, popular culture, censorship, and the universe of discourse in which these phenomena exist

 id : 243578 ISBN : 067470777X  | name : The Problem of Order  |  description : At the end of the twentieth century, many fear that the bonds holding civil society together have come undone. Yet, as the noted scholar Dennis Wrong shows us, our generation is not alone in fearing a breakdown of social ties and a descent into violent conflict. Modern masters such as Hobbes, Rousseau, Freud, Mead, Parsons, Marx, Durkheim, and Weber tried to understand what in human nature provokes social cooperation and solidarity and what arouses conflict and chaos. To minimize discord and promote civility, society must grasp the psychological and sociological elements of human nature involved in attaining that end. The author affords an illuminating perspective on our own efforts to create a well-functioning system that allows for productive and meaningful lives and remains open to change and growth. This important book reveals the individual and social processes that offer potential for reconciliation in the present and the future.

 id : 243637 ISBN : 0813390656  | name : Minds Of Their Own  |  description : Do Animals have ideas? Do they experience pain like humans? Do they think about objects that they cannot see? About situations that have occurred in the past? Do they consciously make plans for the future or do they simply react unthinkingly to objects as they appear and situations as they arise? All of these questions have bearing on whether or not animals have consciousness. The advent of computers that think has lead us to consider intelligence in a way we never thought possible a decade ago. But when and how does information processing in the brain become automatic?In Minds of Their Own, Lesley J. Rogers examines the issue of animal thought both sympathetically and critically by looking at the different behavior characteristics of a variety of animals, the evolution of the brain and when consciousness might have evolved. To most people, to be conscious means to be aware of oneself as well as to be aware of others. But does this hold true for animals? The answer may have implications which transcend mere scientific inquiry: if animals are cognizant creatures, what, if any, moral responsibility do humans have to assure their rights? This timely book examines this issue and others by emphasizing comparisons between humans and animals: how we evolved; how we remember; how we learn.

 id : 243751 ISBN : 0451211936  | name : The Other Woman  |  description : New York Times bestselling author Eric Jerome Dickey presents one of his most intimate and emotionally resonant novelsa story about marriage, infidelity, and sweet and savage revenge. She works nights. He works days. Their sex is routine. Their conversations are empty. Somethings got to give. It does, when she discovers her husbands affair. The delicate fabric of their increasingly tenuous marriage is torn asunderbut neither is prepared for what happens next. An unforgivable betrayal is about to yield the most unexpected surprises, as a husband and wife face a challenge of trust, faith, and the staying power of love.... Dickey has developed a knack for creating characters who elicit both rage and sympathyThe nameless narrator, a routine-bound suburban Californian, learns of her husband's philandering ways. But this dame is no hapless victim of infidelity: She takes chargeDickey taps the intimate emotions of a woman whose hurt we feel viscerally.Entertainment Weekly

Now, journalist and nightworld denizen Anthony Haden-Guest takes us behind the velvet rope that separated the celebrities from the wanna-bes, into an all-night world of revelry, sensation, and decadence. Going beyond the endless partying with Liza, Bianca, Halston, Andy, and Mick, Haden-Guest probes the seamy underside of Studio 54: the drugs, the deaths, and the corruption that eventually shuttered the club. It is the story of Studio 54's flamboyant owners, Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, who achieved early success beyond their wildest imaginings, came within a hair's breadth of great power, and then crashed and burned.

 id : 243786 ISBN : 0142004677  | name : Sex, Time, and Power  |  description : As in the bestselling The Alphabet Versus the Goddess, Leonard Shlains provocative new book promises to change the way readers view themselves and where they came from. Sex, Time, and Power offers a tantalizing answer to an age-old question: Why did big-brained Homo sapiens suddenly emerge some 150,000 years ago? The key, according to Shlain, is female sexuality. Drawing on an awesome breadth of research, he shows how, long ago, the narrowness of the newly bipedal human females pelvis and the increasing size of infants heads precipitated a crisis for the species. Natural selection allowed for the adaptation of the human female to this environmental stress by reconfiguring her hormonal cycles, entraining them with the periodicity of the moon. The results, however, did much more than ensure our existence; they imbued women with the concept of time, and gave them control over sexa power that males sought to reclaim. And the possibility of achieving immortality through heirs drove men to construct patriarchal cultures that went on to dominate so much of human history. From the nature of courtship to the evolution of language, Shlains brilliant and wide-ranging exploration stimulates new thinking about very old matters.

 id : 243789 ISBN : 0571198104  | name : 800 Years of Women's Letters  |  description : "In this engrossing anthology, the first truly comprehensive study of women's letters, Olga Kenyon takes us from the twelfth century to the present day and explores the tradition of female letter-writing that has existed for over eight centuries." "Here is Heloise writing to Abelard's 'superior wisdom' of 'how much I have lost in you' from twelfth-century Paris; Margaret Paston, the efficient manager of her husband's estate, vividly describing her troubles in affectionate letters to her husband while he was practising law in London during the Wars of the Roses; Elizabeth I firmly but tactfully refusing Erik of Sweden's offer of marriage as she 'highly commends this single life'; Queen Victoria complaining to Sir Robert Peel about the 'disgrace' in the neglect of Buckingham Palace; Jane Austen writing to her sister Cassandra, and Fanny Burney on Dr Johnson; Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf exchanging intimate thoughts on their lives and writing; Lady Mary Wortley Montagu describing how, abandoned by her lover, she rebuilds her life and her garden in Italy 'enjoying every amusement that solitude can afford'; and many more lesser known women whose writing reveals much of their day to day lives and the sometimes restricted world they inhabited. The collection has a wide geographical range: Mary Kingsley writes of her experiences travelling in the Congo, and the voices of women in America, France and Spain, such as George Sand and La Pasionaria, can also be heard." "The letters are divided into chapters thematically: How Women View their Roles, Friendship, Childhood and Education, Love and Sexual Passion, Marriage and Childbirth, Housekeeping and Daily Life, Work, War and Alleviating Suffering, Travellers and Travelling, Illness and Ageing, Political Skills. An appendix covers the epistolary novel, and a full bibliography is also included." "Both entertaining and informative, the letters reveal the nature of women's lives throughout the centuries, and provide an invaluable historic resource. Despite radical differences, these letters display compassion, analysis, humility, humour and love. A captivating insight into past women's lives, 800 Years of Women's Letters will be enjoyed by all, and will be particularly welcomed by historians and those interested in women's studies."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

 id : 243794 ISBN : 2742739238  | name : Mon cas personnel  |  description : L'être qui jusqu'alors vous aimait vous lance un matin au visage un mot, une phrase ou même une porte et termine ainsi votre histoire dans l'instant. À moins que ce ne soit vous qui, par courage ou par folie, en décidiez, mais finalement c'est la même chose, l'amour bascule vers la rupture. Pour Alain Conlang, la solitude est une angoisse, l'abandon une obsession, et il lui semble préférable de vivre un amour sans passion plutôt que de ne rien vivre du tout. Malgré son humour et sa bonne éducation, il constate que son point de vue est par beaucoup partagé et, anticipant sur la rupture, il met au point une méthode : comment survivre au chagrin d'amour ou ne plus souffrir pour de mauvaises raisons. Photocopiée, distribuée, sa méthode remporte un immense succès. Alain Conlang devient gourou, homme d'affaires, analyste à ses heures et de plus en plus amoureux. Dans ce troisième roman, Ilan Duran Cohen s'impose encore davantage dans le territoire du tendre et de l'humour. La singulière aventure d'Alain Conlang au cur de la vie des autres, ses errances amoureuses et sa fragilité atavique viennent ici faire écho à l'extrême sensibilité d'une relation familiale dépeinte avec la délicatesse d'une douce métaphore.

 id : 243806 ISBN : 2859405313  | name : Water music  |  description : Le XVIIIe siècle expire, dans les convulsions que l'on sait. Tandis que Paris se fatigue de la guillotine, que Londres continue à se saouler au gin, l'explorateur écossais Mungo Park découvre le royaume de Ségou, en Afrique, où la folie humaine s'exprime encore avec une simplicité biblique. De retour au pays, il redécouvre un monde - le sien, mais il l'avait un peu oublié - où le progrès est en train de se faire les dents. Aveuglément, cruauté, extravagance sont mieux que jamais au rendez-vous, cependant que la marionnette humaine gigote bravement et tente, bien en vain, d'éviter les mauvais coups. Pour les inconditionnels de T.C. Boyle (Prix médicis/Etranger, 1997), Water Music (1981) fait un peu figure de livre-fétiche. L'auteur y a mis, outre son désir de provoquer notre époque, cette ambition parfaitement folle : rassembler en un même creuset toutes les formes de fiction où le génie anglo-saxon a excellé depuis trois cents ans, du conte libertin en costume d'époque au roman noir américain. La critique, éblouie par le produit de cette alchimie, compara le livre au Cent ans de solitude de Garcia Marquez, au Tom Jones de Fielding... rien de moins. 700 pages dont le moins qu'on puisse dire est qu'elles ne sont pas de tout repos.

Dites-vous simplement que je suis galeriste, donc expert, donc aux premières loges pour décider que telle acné est de l'art, ou que telle autre ne l'est pas. En ce moment c'est le professionnel qui vous parle. " Guinness, galeriste de profession, est à quelques mois de la retraite quand il tombe amoureux de Chanel, une rousse incendiaire bien de son âge. Mais entre ses enfants, qui ne rêvent que de le placer en maison de repos, et ses soi-disant amis Zippo et Milk-shake, qui ont eux aussi des vues sur la belle, l'histoire semble mal engagée. D'autant plus que Guinness, pour la première fois depuis quarante ans, est victime d'une soudaine poussée d'acné. Mais loin de se résigner, une idée de génie le traverse - il décrète ladite acné " uvre d'art ", décide de l'exposer et de la vendre dans sa galerie... pour séduire sa Chimène et la ravir aux autres !
 id : 243808 ISBN : 0060723521  | name : Two Old Women  |  description : Based on an Athabascan Indian legend passed along for many generations from mothers to daughters of the upper Yukon River Valley in Alaska, this is the suspenseful, shocking, ultimately inspirational tale of two old women abandoned by their tribe during a brutal winter famine. Though these women have been known to complain more than contribute, they now must either survive on their own or die trying. In simple but vivid detail, Velma Wallis depicts a landscape and way of life that are at once merciless and starkly beautiful. In her old women, she has created two heroines of steely determination whose story of betrayal, friendship, community and forgiveness "speaks straight to the heart with clarity, sweetness and wisdom" (Ursula K. Le Guin).

Mais plus tard viendrait l'heure de la vengeance, quand ils seraient sortis d'ici... s'ils en sortaient. Le gros homme ouvrit la fenêtre. Le froid s'engouffra dans la chambre avec voracité. Quelques flocons de neige entrèrent également et disparurent aussitôt, ne laissant que de minuscules traces d'humidité sur le plancher. Winock sourit à la nuit, il sourit à l'immensité déserte autour de lui. Il sourit en songeant comme ce serait bon de serrer entre ses doigts la vie de ces salauds, de la serrer, et, lentement, de la broyer...

Though the creation of cheap fusion has undermined the Worlds as a source of solar energy, they still welcome many tourists and offer plenty of raw materials for export. For example, New New York is almost pure steel. And, from that city comes Marianne O'Hara, a brilliant political-science student who has elected to spend a postgraduate year on Earth--where she unwittingly finds herself caught up in a group of fanatics looking to start another revolution in America.even if it means the destruction of the planet.

Drawing on his experiences in France as a volunteer ambulance driver, Cummings takes us through a series of mistakes that led to his being arrested for treason and sent to prison. Out of this episode Cummings produced a unique work a story of oppression, injustice, and imprisonment presented in a high-spirited manner as if it were a lark, a work of new linguistic energy that celebrates the individual and opposes all structures that stifle him. This edition restores to the work much material that was deleted from the manuscript for the book's 1922 publication and is illustrated with drawings Cummings made while imprisoned in France."

 id : 243944 ISBN : 0953658562  | name : Hello World  |  description : 'Hello World' is the story of a life online. Part travelogue, part memoir, Sue Thomas draws on her online travels as well as her physical journeys in the USA, Australia, Spain and England. While the book is non-fiction, it is a direct descendent of 'Correspondence', Thomas extraordinary novel that also deals with the synergies between digital and physical worlds. Like its fictional counterpart, Hello World will trigger feelings in readers of recognition and will stimulate debate on the nature of the physical in a wired world for years to come. First published in 2004. 'This is a book about a love affair. It's also a meditation on a phenomenon that has changed not just our lives but our perceptions of ourselves.' The Independent. '...an essential tour guide to the poetics of time, space and gender in the Information Age. This book is quite simply a Baedeker to the cyber-realm.' Carolyn Guertin. '...engagingly and warmly written, 'Hello World' combines first-person meditations with a wealth of information. Highly recommended for first-time users and those who want to try dipping their toes into the cyberwaters.' N. Katherine Hayles. '...embracing digital media for its freedom and life beyond the physical page, her writings fuse the surfaces, textures, histories and interactions of our bodies and minds.' Robin Rimbaud / Scanner. 'Sue Thomas is one of the most innovation thinkers, promoters and facilitators on the web.' Stelarc. '...anyone who feels both seduced and appalled by the complexities of embedded technology will empathise with this account of the personal highs and lows of an intimate relationship with technology.' Jenny Wolmark. 'Speaking with ease and authority, earned through years of immersive investigation, Sue Thomas critiques virtuality in a manner which makes this book accessible to those who are new to the networked world, as well as a must-read for those already there.' Melinda Rackham. 'Hello World is fascinating, almost hypnotic. Thomas travels all over the physical world, and all over the virtual world, visiting sights and sites of intrinsic and historical interest. She describes what she sees, tells us how the experience affects her, and recounts how past travelers have marked these conceptual landscapes. Thomas invokes Thoreau throughout the book, and the comparison is apt: As Thoreau's observations of the activity around Walden Pond always told us as much about him as they did about the nature he studied, so, too, Thomas's observations reveal much about herself. The intensity of her love for cyberspace is manifest in her attentiveness to the detail of each virtual experience.' Tekka. 'Thomas offers a way of being in the world that refuses hierarchies and primacies and offers us a model of an engaged and creative practice that is both virtual and real.' RealTime. 'As a mix it's intense and entrancing, and it demonstrates the ease with which computers, electronic communications, and lives all intertwine beyond the home.' Alan Sondheim.

 id : 243975 ISBN : 0813016231  | name : A River in Flood, and Other Florida Stories  |  description : About Nine Florida Stories by Marjory Stoneman Douglas: "Written as entertainment for a mass market . . . crammed with colorful characters, vivid incidents and palpable atmosphere. . . . A reminder of a Florida gone by or fast disappearing."--Orlando Sentinel "Reflects the same concerns found in her better-known non-fiction work--a fascination with the beauty of Florida and a warning against its imminent destruction."--Tallahassee Democrat In the pantheon of Florida writers, Marjory Stoneman Douglas (1890-1998) is cherished as the grande dame. Famous as the author of The Everglades: River of Grass, prolific as a writer, and passionate as an environmental crusader for almost a century, she became the nation's best link to a remarkable era in Florida history. The timeless themes of her stories in this new collection resonate with interest for readers today. Whether the subject is hurricanes, cockfighting, real estate deals, struggling immigrants, or corruption in the Everglades, Douglas wrote about it with distinction--and usually first. Originally published in the Saturday Evening Post during the 1920s and 1930s, the golden age of the short story, these nine works have never before been collected or available in one place. Kevin M. McCarthy, who edited the companion volume, Nine Florida Stories by Marjory Stoneman Douglas, offers an introduction to each story, explaining its significance, setting, unusual references, place in Douglas's works, and significance to the history of South Florida. Kevin M. McCarthy, professor of English and Florida studies at the University of Florida, is the author or editor of nineteen other books, including Florida Lighthouses, Florida Stories, and More Florida Stories (published by the University Press of Florida). The stories: "At Home on the Marcel Waves" "Solid Mahogany" "Goodness Gracious, Agnes" "A River in Flood" "The Mayor of Flamingo" "Stepmother" "You Got to Go, But You Don't Have to Come Back" "High-Goal Man" "Wind Before Morning"

The first is to help promote the giver's spiritual growth... The second reason is even simpler. Christian discipleship is Christian stewardship. How could it be anything else? How else do God's people grow in grace?" In the tradition of Schaller's many other top-selling books, 44 Ways to Expand the Financial Base of Your Congregation contains strategies tested and proven in scores of local congregations across the U.S. and Canada. The 44 strategies are humorously illustrated by Edward Lee Tucker's "Friar Tuck" cartoon characters.

 id : 243995 ISBN : 0198547668  | name : Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy  |  description : The technique of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an important tool in biochemistry and biophysics for the understanding of the structure and ultimately, the function of biomolecules. This textbook explains the salient features of biological NMR spectroscopy to undergraduates and postgraduates taking courses in NMR, biological NMR, physical biochemistry, and biophysics. Unlike other books in the general field of NMR (except the advanced treatises), the approach here is tointroduce and make use of quantum mechanical product operators as well as the classical vector method of explaining the bewildering array of pulse sequences available today. The book covers two- dimensional, three- dimensional, and four- dimensional NMR and their application to protein and DNA structure determination. A unique feature is the coverage of the biological aspects of solid- state NMR spectroscopy. The author provides many selected examples from the research literature, illustratingthe applications of NMR spectroscopy to biological proteins.

Je réussis à dire sa vie en quelques phrases brèves, nues. Je me trouvais dans un état d'abattement tel que j'entendais à peine ce que je disais. Et c'est dans cet état seulement que je fus capable d'exprimer toute la douloureuse vérité de cette vie. Un aviateur venu d'un pays lointain rencontre une femme du même pays que le sien et, pendant très peu de jours, dans une ville dont il ne restera bientôt que des ruines, ils s'aiment ; puis il part au bout de la terre pour conduire les avions destinés an front, et meurt, en s'écrasant sur un versant de glace, sous le ciel blême du cercle polaire. Je l'avais dit autrement. Non pas mieux, mais plus brièvement encore, plus près de l'essence de leur amour.

Towards the end of 1971, the then Home Secretary for Northern Ireland, Reginald Maudling, said that he could foresee a time when IRA violence could be reduced to an acceptable level. People weren't quite sure what he meant. How could any level of violence ever be acceptable? On Saturday, 4 March 1972, a no-warning bomb went off in a crowded restaurant in central Belfast. Two women were killed. 130 people were injured. Their names were added to the growing list of victims of the troubles. The real victims were the people left behind. This is their story. It's a story of survivors, of people who lived through the darkest years in Northern Ireland's history. In the telling of it, perhaps it will shed some light on how, as a nation, such people arrived at the point where an acceptable level of violence became for them, a way of life.

 id : 244116 ISBN : 0465041256  | name : Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked Ten Moral Tales From The Forest  |  description : In Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked Catherine Orenstein reveals for the first time the intricate sexual politics, moral ambiguities and philosophical underpinnings of Red Riding Hood's epic journey to Grandmother's house--and how, from the nursery on, the story influences our view of the world. Beginning with its first publication as a cautionary tale on the perils of seduction, written in reaction to the licentiousness of the court of Louis XIV, Orenstein traces the many and various lives the tale has lived since then, from its appearance in modern advertisements for cosmetics and automobiles to the inspiration it brought to poets like Anne Sexton and its starring role in pornographic films. In Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked, Red appears as seductress, hapless victim, riot grrrrl, femme fatale, and even she-wolf, as Orenstein shows how, through centuries of different guises, the story has served as a barometer of social and sexual mores pertaining to women. Full of fascinating history, generous wit, and intelligent analysis, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked proves that the story of one young girl's trip through the woods continues to be one of our most compelling modern myths.

White Fang (1906), which London conceived as a 'complete antithesis and companion piece to The Call of the Wild, ' is the tale of an abused wolf-dog tamed by exposure to civilization. Also included in this volume is 'To Build a Fire, ' a marvelously desolate short story set in the Klondike, but containing all the elements of a classic Greek tragedy.

Two new chapters on basic ecology (Chapters 3 and 4) have been added to this edition to enhance this science-based book. This text differs from Miller's comprehensive text, LIVING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, 13th Edition, because there is much less detail and more integration of topics, with a different chapter order. For example, the following topics have been integrated into single chapters: human population dynamics and urban problems are in Chapter 5, nonrenewable and renewable energy resources are in Chapter 6, terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity are in Chapter 7, water resources and water pollution are in Chapter 12, solid and hazardous waste are in Chapter 13, and environmental economics, politics, and worldviews are in Chapter 14. For the first time ever in a Miller textbook, students will receive a CD-ROM, entitled Interactive Concepts in Environmental Science. This groundbreaking addition integrates nearly 100 engaging animations and interactions with chapter summaries, flashcards, and Web-based quizzes. Organized by chapter, students will find links to relevant resources, narrated animations, interactive figures, and prompts to review material and test themselves. Miller has remained true to his hallmark features, such as high quality end-of-chapter questions, an orientation toward prevention rather than clean-up, an integration of Web resources and video, and a balanced presentation of controversial environmental issues.

On French Prairie in the newly forming Oregon Territory, Marie strives to meet the needs of her conflict-ridden neighbors: British settlers and Americans, missionaries and disease-stricken natives, fur trappers and French Canadian farming families, and the surviving natives of the region. At the same time, as a mother, Marie must weave together the threads of an unraveling family. One daughter compares and judges as she seeks to find her place; another reaches for elusive evidence of her mothers love. Maries memories are threatened with the emergence of a figure from the past. In the midst of this turmoil, Marie discovers an empowering spiritual truth: Unconditional love can shed light on even the darkest places in the heart.

Now, in Savages and Civilization, Weatherford broadens his focus to examine how civilization threatens to obliterate unique tribal and ethnic cultures around the worldand in the process imperils its own existence. As Weatherford explains, the relationship between civilized and savage peoples through history has encompassed not only violence, but also a surprising degree of cooperation, mutual influence, trade, and intermarriage. But this relationship has now entered a critical stage everywhere in the world, as indigenous peoples fiercely resist the onslaught of a global civilization that will obliterate their identities. Savages and Civilization powerfully demonstrates that our survival as a species is based not on a choice between savages and civilization, but rather on a commitment to their vital coexistence.

 id : 244423 ISBN : 0786866756  | name : History of Britain, A - Volume I  |  description : Simon Schama's magesterial new book encompasses over 1,500 years of Britain's history, from the first Roman invasions to the early seventeenth century, and the extraordinary reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Schama, the author of the highly acclaimed Citizens and The Embarrassment of Riches, is one of the most popular and celebrated historians of our day, and in this magnificent work he brings history to dramatic life with a wealth of stories and vivid, colorful detail, reanimating familiar figures and events and drawing them skillfully into a powerful and compelling narrative. Schama's perspective moves from the birth of civilization to the Norman Conquest; through the religious wars and turbulance of the Middle Ages to the sovereignties of Henry II, Richard I and King John; through the outbreak of the Black Death, which destroyed nearly half of Europe's population, through the reign of Edward I and the growth of national identity in Wales and Scotland, to the intricate conflicts of the Tudors and the clash between Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots. Driven by the drama of the stories themselves but exploring at the same time a network of interconnected themes--the formation of a nation state, the cyclical nature of power, the struggles between the oppressors and the oppressed--this is a superbly readable and illuminating account of a great nation, and its extraordinary history.

The twists and turns and the direction their lives ultimately take are a source of inspiration to those contemplating Judaism, and to all in search of faith. They are a gift to the Jewish people.

Out of passivity and paranoia, ethnic hatred and religious fanaticism that have riven two generations of Eastern Europeans, Kapuscinski has composed a symphony for a collapsing empirea work that translates history into the hopes and sufferings of the human beings condemned to live it.

 id : 244517 ISBN : 1401600190  | name : Genealogy 101  |  description : A recent Maritz Poll reported that 60% of Americans are interested in their family history. And with good reason. Through genealogy, you can go back into history to meet people who have had more influence on your life than any others -- your ancestors. And the better you get to know your ancestors, the better you will get to know yourself: the who's and what's and why's of you. Barbara Renick, a nationally-known lecturer on genealogy, tells the uninitiated researcher the steps needed to find out who their ancestors really were, and brings together for even the more experienced genealogical researchers the important principles and practices. She covers such topics as the importance of staying organized and how to go about it; where and how to look for information in libraries, historical societies, and on the internet; recognizing that just because something is in print doesn't mean it's right; and how to prepare to visit the home where your ancestors lived. Genealogy 101 is the first book to read when you want to discover who your ancestors were, where they lived, and what they did.

 id : 244527 ISBN : 0671748076  | name : Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain  |  description : Mark Twain, the American comic genius who portrayed, named, and in part exemplified Americas Gilded Age, comes alive in Justin Kaplans extraordinary biography. With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.

 id : 244542 ISBN : 0688042686  | name : Barbarossa  |  description : On June 22, 1941, before dawn, German tanks and guns began firing across the Russian border. It was the beginning of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, one of the most brutal campaigns in the history of warfare. Four years later, the victorious Red Army has suffered a loss of seven million lives. Alan Clark's incisive analysis succeeds in explaining how a fighting force that in one two-month period lost two million men was nevertheless able to rally to defeat the Wehrmacht. The Barbarossa campaign included some of the greatest episodes in military history: the futile attack on Moscow in the winter of 1941-42, the siege of Stalingrad, the great Russian offensive beginning in 1944 that would lead the Red Army to the historic meeting with the Americans at the Elbe and on to victory in Berlin. Barbarossa is a classic of miltary history. This paperback edition contains a new preface by the author.

 id : 244555 ISBN : 0060928077  | name : Integrity  |  description : Why do we care more about winning than about playing by the rules? Integrity - all of us are in favor of it, but nobody seems to know how to make sure that we get it. From presidential candidates to crusading journalists to the lords of collegiate sports, everybody promises to deliver integrity, yet all too often, the promises go unfulfilled. Stephen Carter examines why the virtue of integrity holds such sway over the American political imagination. By weaving together insights from philosophy, theology, history and law, along with examples drawn from current events and a dose of personal experience, Carter offers a vision of integrity that has implications for everything from marriage and politics to professional football. He discusses the difficulties involved in trying to legislate integrity as well as the possibilities for teaching it. As the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, "In a measured and sensible voice, Carter attempts to document some of the paradoxes and pathologies that result from pervasive ethical realism... If the modern drift into relativism has left us in a cultural and political morass, Carter suggests that the assumption of personal integrity is the way out."

 id : 244569 ISBN : 1893554694  | name : The War Over Iraq  |  description : As the crisis with Iraq continues, Americans have questions. Is war really necessary? What can it accomplish? What broad vision of U.S. foreign policy underlies the determination to remove Saddam Hussein? What were the failures of the last couple of decades that brought us to a showdown with a dictator developing weapons of mass destruction? What is the relationship between war with Iraq and the events of 9-11? The answers to these questions are found in this timely book by two of America's leading foreign policy thinkers. Kristol and Kaplan lay out a detailed rationale for action against Iraq. But to understand why we must fight Saddam, the authors assert, it is necessary to go beyond the details of his weapons of mass destruction, his past genocidal actions against Iran and his own people, and the U.N. resolutions he has ignored. The explanation begins with how the dominant policy ideas of the last decade--Clintonian liberalism and Republican realpolitik--led American policymakers to turn a blind eye to the threat Iraq has posed for well over a decade. As Kristol and Kaplan make clear, the war over Iraq is in large part a war of competing ideas about America's role in the world. The authors provide the first comprehensive explanation of the strategy of "preemption" guiding the Bush Administration in dealing with this crisis. They show that American foreign policy for the 21st century is being forged in the crucible of our response to Saddam. The war over Iraq will presumably be the end of Saddam Hussein. But it will be the beginning of a new era in American foreign policy. William Kristol and Lawrence Kaplan are indispensable guides to the era that lies ahead.

Channelers claim a spirit actually enters their body and speaks 'guide' through them. The key issue is this: exactly who or what are these spirit guides? Many ideas, even bizarre ones, have been considered. Are they merely the hallucinations of the mentally unstable, as doctors say? Are they parts of the unconscious mind available to us all, as some psychologists say? Are they creatures from the future, or are they from civilizations deep in space, as some scientists say?.. Are they genuine spirit beings such as angels, the dead, or the 'gods' and nature spirits of various religious traditions, as the channelers say? Or are they another category of 'being' entirely -- the demons mentioned in the Bible?.. If one looks for a theory to explain all the facts, the demon theory cannot be ignored, whether or not it is personally appealing"--About this booklet.

 id : 244581 ISBN : 0334024765  | name : Thinking About God  |  description : Growing out of a series of public lectures presented to a large audience of non-theologians, this book is one of the most attractive introductions to theology to appear in recent years. Perhaps, as the author herself indicates, introduction is not the best word to describe the book. For above all, the book is an invitation to share Dorothee Solle s enthusiasm for theology, and her delight in the beauty and the power of religious and theological language and the themes it expresses. Thinking about God covers all of the major areas of modern theology. After discussing the nature of systematic theology and comparing orthodox, liberal, and radical approaches, it looks at the use of the Bible in theology. Then follow chapters on creation, sin, feminist liberation theology, the understanding of grace, black theology, Jesus, cross and resurrection, the kingdom of God and the church, the theology of peace, the end of theism, and the question of God. A bibliography is provided at the end of each chapter, and Dorothee Solle, who is familiar with theology on both sides of the Atlantic, has herself revised the entries for the English-language edition. Dorothee Solle has taught philosophy, literature, and theology at several German universities, and has been on the faculty of Union Theological Seminary, New York.

 id : 244599 ISBN : 0676973795  | name : Sputnik Diner  |  description : From an award-winning writer reminiscent of Richard Russo and Russell Banks: get ready for a heady and heartbreaking stay in Nanticoke, home of the Sputnik Diner. Travelling on Highway 3, along the upper lip of Lake Erie and through a moustache of tobacco fields and sky, we arrive in Nanticoke, Ontario. At the heart of the town is the Sputnik Diner, a smoky grill where the jukebox whirs out an ever-changing soundtrack. Navigating their way through the lies and sexual betrayals are Grace, waitress and self-defeating artist; Buzz, who offers the cook's eye view of the eccentric patrons and staff; and Marcel, the gruff French-Canadian owner who doles out hilarious malapropisms and his own peculiar brand of hospitality. In muscular prose, Maddocks traces the lives of flawed, gutsy, and utterly loveable characters: an immigrant family from Wales, struggling to find their place in the ragged, darkly absurd world of tobacco-belt Ontario; two young brothers who steal the family car and try to come to grips with their father's cancer out on the dinosaur mini-putt course in the pouring rain; and Grace, who seeks out her birth parents only to confront the dizzying epiphanies of that momentous discovery. There are others too, whose stalled dreams, gritty hopes and humour spark through the Sputnik Diner universe.

 id : 244718 ISBN : 0060193867  | name : Charles  |  description : Charles, Prince of Wales, has long been the subject of intense scrutiny and speculation. Everyone assumes that they know the story of the Prince's life and his failed marriage to Diana. Diana herself told the world in no uncertain terms about her unhappiness with the British Royal Family, leaving no doubt as to whom she held responsible. But Diana's version was only part of the story. Penny Junor's new biography, Charles: Victim or Villain?, reveals the startling complexities and contradictions of a man born to a position of unique privilege. On the occasion of the Prince's fiftieth birthday it provides fresh perspective and entirely revolutionizes the way we think about Charles, his marriage and his mistress. Drawing on the memories, experiences and observations of those closest to the Prince, the Princess and Camilla -- some of whom have never spoken before -- Penny Junor is in an unrivaled position to explode and explain the popular myths. Her analysis of the Prince's marriage to Diana, a vulnerable but difficult young woman, and his relationship with Camilla, earthy and independent, results in a provocative new portrait of the man who will be King.

In eloquent prose, Pogany portrays how the Holocaust destroyed the brothers' close childhood bond: his father, a survivor of a Nazi internment camp, denounced Christianity and returned to the Judaism of his birth, while his uncle, who found shelter in an Italian monastic community during the war, became a Catholic priest. Even after emigrating to America the brothers remained estranged, each believing the other a traitor to their family's faith. This tragic memoir is a rich, moving family portrait as well as an objective historical account of the rupture between Jews and Catholics.

Why do we do it? Or, more exactly, why do we want to? The Last Face You'll Ever See is not about the polarizing issues of the death penalty -- it is a firsthand report about the culture of executions: the executioners, the death-row inmates, and everyone involved in the act.

 id : 244739 ISBN : 0375705023  | name : An Ice-Cream War  |  description : "Rich in character and incident, An Ice-Cream War fulfills the ambition of the historical novel at its best." --The New York Times Book Review Booker Prize Finalist "Boyd has more than fulfilled the bright promise of [his] first novel. . . . He is capable not only of some very funny satire but also of seriousness and compassion." --Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times 1914. In a hotel room in German East Africa, American farmer Walter Smith dreams of Theodore Roosevelt. As he sleeps, a railway passenger swats at flies, regretting her decision to return to the Dark Continent--and to her husband. On a faraway English riverbank, a jealous Felix Cobb watches his brother swim, and curses his sister-in-law-to-be. And in the background of the world's daily chatter: rumors of an Anglo-German conflict, the likes of which no one has ever seen. In An Ice-Cream War, William Boyd brilliantly evokes the private dramas of a generation upswept by the winds of war. After his German neighbor burns his crops--with an apology and a smile--Walter Smith takes up arms on behalf of Great Britain. And when Felix's brother marches off to defend British East Africa, he pursues, against his better judgment, a forbidden love affair. As the sons of the world match wits and weapons on a continent thousands of miles from home, desperation makes bedfellows of enemies and traitors of friends and family. By turns comic and quietly wise, An Ice-Cream War deftly renders lives capsized by violence, chance, and the irrepressible human capacity for love. "Funny, assured, and cleanly, expansively told, a seriocomic romp. Boyd gives us studies of people caught in the side pockets of calamity and dramatizes their plights with humor, detail and grit." --Harper's "Boyd has crafted a quiet, seamless prose in which story and characters flow effortlessly out of a fertile imagination. . . . The reader emerges deeply moved." --Newsday

 id : 245269 ISBN : 0880015780  | name : The Sun at Midday  |  description : For Gini Alhadeff, there was rarely a difference between feeling at home and feeling foreign. Born to an Italian family in Alexandria, Egypt, she lived in places as far-flung as Cairo, Khartoum, Florence, and Tokyo; raised Catholic, she did not learn of her Sephardic Jewish roots until she was living in New York in her twenties. In The Sun at Midday, Alhadeff traces her unusual ancestral history, seeking the source of her chameleon-like skills of adaptation. Through the reminiscences of family members--among them cousin Pierre, a worldly priest and celebrity confessor who recalls the sumptuous lives of Alexandrian ex-pats, and her uncle Nissim, now a gynecologist in Queens, who survived the horrors of the Holocaust--she unearths a wealth of rich and strange stories. Woven together with exhilarating prose, they form an uncommonly affecting memoir of a family whose past defies summation, and of Alhadeff's own life both in it and apart from it.

 id : 245289 ISBN : 0440236436  | name : Dead Easy  |  description : Midcentury America was governed from the center, a bipartisan consensus ofpoliticians and public opinion that supported government spending on education, the construction ofa vast network of interstate highways, healthcare for senior citizens, and environmental protection.These projects were paid for by a steeply progressive tax code, with a top tax rate at one pointduring the Republican Eisenhower administration of 91 percent. Today, a similar agenda of governmentaction (and progressive taxation) would be portrayed as dangerously left wing. At the same time,radically anti-government and anti-tax opinions (with no evidence to support them) are consideredpart of the mainstream. In Take Back the Center, Peter Wenz makes the case for asane, reality-based politics that reclaims the center for progressive policies. The key, he argues,is taxing the wealthy at higher rates. The tax rate for the wealthiest Americans has declined fromthe mid-twentieth-century high of 91 percent to a twenty-first-century low of 36 percent--even associal programs are gutted and the gap betweeen rich and poor widens dramatically. Ever since RonaldReagan famously declared that government was the problem and not the solution, conservatives havehad an all-purpose answer to any question: smaller government and lower taxes. Wenz offers animpassioned counterargument. He explains the justice of raising the top tax rates significantly,making a case for less income inequality (and countering society's worship of the wealthy), and heoffers suggestions for how to spend the increased tax revenues: K-12 education, tuition relief,transportation and energy infrastructure, and universal health care. Armed with Wenz'sevidence-driven arguments, progressives can position themselves where they belong: in the mainstreamof American politics and at the center of American political conversations, helping their countryaddress a precipitous decline in equality and quality of life.
 id : 245291 ISBN : 0060937173  | name : Discovering the Body  |  description : Discovering the Body is a gripping novel filled with psychological suspense, sensitivity, and emotional complexity. With this stunning debut, Mary Howard has crafted an electrifying and hauntingly evocative novel of truth and perception, of the ties we tell others-and the lies we tell ourselves. Two years ago Linda Garbo left her graphic design job in Minneapolis to open a printmaking studio in a small town in Iowa with the encouragement of Luci Cole, a weaver and an old friend from art school. Arriving in Linden Grove for good, Linda agrees to stay with Luci and her boyfriend, Charlie, in their old farmhouse outside of town until the renovations to her new studio space are completed. But the following afternoon as she is driving down the long winding road toward Luci's house, Linda sees Luci's neighbor, Peter Garvey, walking out the front door-and when Linda enters the house a few minutes later, she discovers her friend's lifeless body on the kitchen floor. Now, two years later, Peter Garvey has been convicted of Luci's murder. Linda is married to Charlie and living in the very house where Luci died. And she is convinced someone is following her. As she begins to confront her fears-approaching the man she believes is spying on her, visiting Peter Garvey in prison-she finally faces the cause for her frequent panic attacks: she was too traumatized by her discovery of Luci's body to be a reliable witness. And if she's identified the wrong man, the killer may still be close by, ready to react if she admits she might have made a mistake. Compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding Luci's final days, Linda finds that Luci was a master at weaving her true colors into a complex tapestry, preferring involvements that required secrecy.

 id : 245484 ISBN : 0030461359  | name : Life in a Turkish Village  |  description : These case studies in cultural anthropology are designed to bring to students insights into the richness and complexity of human life as it is lived in different ways and in different places. They are written by men and women who have lived in societies they write about, and who are professionally trained as observers and interpreters of human behavior. The authors are also teachers, and in writing their books they have kept the students who will read them foremost in their minds. It is our belief that when an understanding of ways of life very different from one's own is gained, abstractions and generalizations about social structure, cultural values, subsistence techniques, and the other universal categories of human social behavior become meaningful. This case study is divided into two parts. In the first part one sees life in an Anatolian village through the eyes of a small boy who is just beginning the long induction into a man's role. In part two the author shifts to a more conventional analysis of Anatolian village life. He presents straightforward descriptive interpretations of the social system, economy, political structure, religious and folk beliefs, and an intriguing chapter on language and a world view.

 id : 245565 ISBN : 1891620029  | name : Fear No Evil  |  description : Temperamentally and intellectually, Natan Sharansky is a man very much like many of uswhich makes this account of his arrest on political grounds, his trial, and ten years' imprisonment in the Orwellian universe of the Soviet gulag particularly vivid and resonant. Since Fear No Evil was originally published in 1988, the Soviet government that imprisoned Sharansky has collapsed. Sharansky has become an important national leader in Israeland serves as Israel's diplomatic liaison to the former Soviet Union! New York Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief Serge Schmemann reflects on those monumental events, and on Sharansky's extraordinary life in the decades since his arrest, in a new introduction to this edition. But the truths Sharansky learned in his jail cell and sets forth in this book have timeless importance so long as rulers anywhere on earth still supress their own peoples. For anyone with an interest in human rightsand anyone with an appreciation for the resilience of the human spirithe illuminates the weapons with which the powerless can humble the powerful: physical courage, an untiring sense of humor, a bountiful imagination, and the conviction that "Nothing they do can humiliate me. I alone can humiliate myself."

 id : 245592 ISBN : 0879754559  | name : Forbidden Fruit  |  description : Fundamentalists from all religious persuasions deny the possibility of morality without belief in God. Yet belief in God is no guarantee of moral virtue - as the evils committed in the name of religion, past and present, have shown. Are there ethical, nonreligious choices that will work for a world in crisis? In this original and penetrating book, America's leading secular humanist philosopher affirms that it is possible to live the good life and be morally responsible without belief in religion. Kurtz delineates the means by which humanity can transcend the limitations of traditional religious loyalties and achieve a higher stage of ethics. In order to progress to a maximum level of creative development, the author maintains that we must be nourished by the "forbidden fruit" of the knowledge of good and evil, grounding principles and values in autonomous reason. This is the path that leads to the discovery of significant ethical truths that can guide both self-reliant conduct and consideration for the rights of others. By breaking the bonds of theistic illusion, we can summon the courage and wisdom to develop a rational ethic based on a realistic appraisal of nature and an awareness of the centrality of the moral decencies common to all peoples. The ultimate key to the good life is to eat of the fruit of the second tree in the Garden of Eden - the tree of life - discovering for ourselves the manifold potentialities for a bountiful existence.

In House of All Nations, the pot is an exclusive private European bank, and the spiders are a rich mixture of high takes gamblers, tax evaders, and shady speculators, all united by their love of money. They burn for it, hunger for it, and indeed would sell their souls for it had they souls to sell. Leading them on the chase is the cynical and mercurial director of the bank, Jules Bertillon, for whom every political or natural disaster is a potential shower of gold. Bertillon is a master of the devious maneuver, and his clients trust and even love him for it. In the end, he is the duper duped, but it is the clients who pay: for Jules, unprincipled to the last, has not been so foolish as to believe in himself.

In these eleven stories Alice Munro proves once again a sensitive and compassionate chronicler of modern times. Drawing us into the potent and intimate corners of various lives, she tells us much about ourselves, our choices, and our experiences of love. Copyright © Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.

 id : 245725 ISBN : 0375760741  | name : The Lessons of Terror  |  description : Military historian Caleb Carrs groundbreaking work anticipated Americas current debates on preemptive military action against terrorist sponsor states, reorganization of the American intelligence system, and the treatment of terrorists as soldiers in supranational armies rather than as criminals. Carrs authoritative exploration demonstrates that the practice of terrorism, employed by national armies as well as extremists since the days of ancient Rome, is ultimately self-defeating. Far from prompting submission, it stiffens enemy resolve and never leads to long-lasting success. Controversial on its initial publication in 2002, The Lessons of Terror has been repeatedly validated by subsequent events. Carrs analysis of individual terrorist acts, and particularly of the history of the Middle East conflict, is fundamental to a deep understanding of the roots of terrorism as well as the steps and reforms that must be taken if the continuing threat of terrorist behavior is to be met effectively today and, finally, eradicated tomorrow.

 id : 245736 ISBN : 0375406131  | name : Abyssinian Chronicles  |  description : Every once in a while there emerges a literary voice with the power and urgency to immerse readers deep within a previously "invisible" culture. From a young African writer who has already earned comparisons to Salman Rushdie and Gabriel Garcia Marquez comes this masterful saga of life in 20th-century Uganda. The teller of this panoramic tale is Mugezi, a quick-witted, sharp-eyed man whose life encompasses the traditional and the modern, the peaceful and the insanely violent, the despotic and the democratic. Born in a rural community in the early 1960s, he is raised by his grandfather, a deposed clan chief, and his great-aunt, or "grandmother," after his parents immigrate to the capital city of Kampala. At age nine, he leaves behind his secure life in the village to join his parents and siblings in the city, where he is first exposed to the despotism and hardship that he will contend with in the years to come. The nightmare reign of Idi Amin and its chaotic aftermath are the backdrop to Mugezi's troubled coming-of-age: his constant struggle with his harsh mother and austere father; his years spent as caregiver to his parents' ever-growing brood of children; his sojourn in a horrifically repressive Catholic seminary. He goes to work as a high school teacher, becomes enmeshed in a tragic romance, finds himself drawn into a dubious, potentially dangerous alliance with the military after Amin's fall and witnesses the widespread ravages of the AIDS virus. Finally, sickened by personal loss and national tragedy, he manages to immigrate to Amsterdam. The details of Mugezi's life provide a foundation for Isegawa's brilliant and profoundly illuminating portrait of the contemporary, postcolonial African experience. Filled with extraordinary characters, animated by a wicked sense of humor and guided by an intense yet clear-eyed compassion, Abyssianian Chronicles is our introduction to a superlative new writer.
 id : 245738 ISBN : 0813321204  | name : Requiem For The Sudan  |  description : After a decade of uneasy peace, the historic conflict between the Northern and Southern Sudanese erupted into violent conflict in 1983. This ferocious civil war has devastated the populace, who have also suffered the ravages of drought and famine. Over a million people have either perished or been displaced. This chilling account is based on a wealth of documents--never made public--from Sudanese government sources, private and foreign governmental famine relief agencies, and international media. The authors graphically recount how the attempts of international and humanitarian organizations to provide food and medical relief have been thwarted by bureaucratic infighting, corruption, greed, and ineptitude. It is a sad tale of the tragic human consequences of the failure of conflict resolution, of organizational mismanagement, and of a government hostile toward its own people.

 id : 245801 ISBN : 0807110388  | name : One South  |  description : If it can be said that there are many Souths, wrote W. J. Cash in The Mind of the South, the fact remains that there is also one South. In the informal, engaging essays brought together in One South, John Shelton Reed focuses on the Souths strong regional identity and on the persistence, well into the last decades if the twentieth century, of Southern cultural distinctiveness. Reed argues that Southerners are similar in much the same way that members if an ethnic group are similar. He discusses the Souths shared cultural values, ranging from serious examinations of Southern violence and regional identity to considerations of Southern humor, country music, and the emergence of a new Southern middle classepitomized by the family of former president Jimmy Carter. Reed opens his volume with three essays dealing with the discipline of sociology and its relation to the South. The first essay proposes ways that sociology can contribute to the mainstream of regional studies; the second traces the history of sociological attention to the South in our century; and the this suggests that the sociological way of thinking may be somewhat alien to well-bred Southerners. In the next section, Reed looks at the question of group identity, arguing in one essay, The Heart of Dixie, that the South is best defined by locating Southerners, rather than by isolating a particular geographic region. Reed then turns his attention to minority and fringe groups within the South, including, in Shalom, YAll, Southern Jews. A final section looks at some of the particular advantages and disadvantages of life in the New South today. Reeds explorations into the regions culture reveal that Southerners are identifiable as a group less by obvious background characteristicseducation, occupation, rural or urban residencethan by shared attitudes toward family and community, religious beliefs and practices, and violence and the private use of force: the kind of things that customarily identify ethnic groups. In this way, One South demonstrates how history and the heritage of Southernness have for now triumphed over the disintegrating forces of geography and economics.

 id : 245814 ISBN : 044991268X  | name : City of Darkness, City of Light  |  description : Robespierre and Danton. These are the names that have come down to us as the architects of the French Revolution. Yet there is another story of that glorious, bloody movement that still lies buried: the courageous women who sparked the revolution by taking to the streets. Now, in her most splendid, thought-provoking novel yet, Marge Piercy brings to vibrant life three of the women who played prominent roles in the most tumultuous turning point in European history, and tells the intimate stories of the men whose names we know so well. Claire Lacombe escapes the grinding poverty of Pamiers by joining a traveling theatrical troupe as an actress. Defiantly independent, strikingly beautiful, she will become a symbol to many as she tests her theory: if men can make things happen, perhaps women can too. . . . Manon Philipon, a jeweler's daughter, worships Rousseau and the life of the mind. When she marries Jean Roland, a minor provincial bureaucrat, she finds she has a talent for politics--albeit as the ghostwriter of her husband's speeches, and the hostess of his salon. . . . Pauline Léon, owner of a chocolate shop in Paris, witnesses the torture and executions of common people who riot for bread. As the revolution gathers momentum, Pauline is certain of one thing: the women must apply the pressure, or their male colleagues will let them starve. And so the Revolutionary Republican Women are born. . . . And while the women make their voices heard in every district, the men sit in makeshift assemblies, willing the revolution into being through infighting and intrigue. The incorruptible Maximilien Robespierre, the earthy and opportunistic Georges Danton, and the intellectual Nicholas Condorcet all vie for power as Paris whips itself into a frenzy. History has recorded their political legacies, but in City of Darkness, City of Light Marge Piercy reveals the innermost thoughts and feelings of these three men, their insecurities and vulnerabilities, the way they loved and sometimes lost what was most precious to them. The women's march on Versailles. The haggling of the Committee for Public Safety. The overarching reach of the Terror. All the events of the revolution explode with the urgency of today's headlines, as Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Marat, Tom Paine, Camille Desmoulins, Olympe de Gouges, and many other legendary figures play their parts on the great stage of history. Marge Piercy has done nothing less than capture the entire sweep of the French Revolution, while opening to us the minds and hearts of six people who changed the world, lived their ideals--and were prepared to die for them.

 id : 245845 ISBN : 0837183391  | name : Mistress to an Age  |  description : J. Christopher Herold vigorously tells the story of the fierce Madame de Stael, revealing her courageous opposition to Napoleon, her whirlwind affairs with the great intellectuals of her day, and her idealistic rebellion against all that was cynical, tyrannical, and passionless. Germaine de Stael's father was Jacques Necker, the finance minister to Louis XVI, and her mother ran an influential literary-political salon in Paris. Always precocious, at nineteen Germaine married the Swedish ambassador to France, Eric Magnus Baron de Stael-Holstein, and in 1785 took over her mother's salon with great success. Germaine and de Stael lived most of their married life apart. She had many brilliant lovers. Talleyrand was the first, Narbonne, the minister of war, another; Benjamin Constant was her most significant and long-lasting one. She published several political and literary essays, including "A Treatise on the Influence of the Passions upon the Happiness of Individuals and of Nations," which became one of the most important documents of European Romanticism. Her bold philosophical ideas, particularly those in "On Literature," caused feverish commotion in France and were quickly noticed by Napoleon, who saw her salon as a rallying point for the opposition. He eventually exiled her from France. This winner of the 1959 National Book Award is "excellent ... detailed, full of color, movement, great names, and lively incident" -- The New York Times. "Mr. Herold's full-bodied biography is clear-eyed, intelligent, and written with abundant wit and zest." -- The Atlantic Monthly.

In six crisp essays, and a brilliant conclusion, he extends our understanding of the nature of peasant reactions to social change appreciably by his skill in isolating and analyzing those factors, which, by a magnification of the anthropologist's techniques, can be shown to be crucial in linking local grievances and protest to larger movements of political transformation."--American Political Science Review "An intellectual tour de force."--Comparative Politics

 id : 245956 ISBN : 0671663941  | name : Stay Alive, My Son  |  description : On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh to open a new and appalling chapter in the story of the twentieth century. On that day, Pin Yathay was a qualified engineer in the Ministry of Public Works. Successful and highly educated, he had been critical of the corrupt Lon Nol regime and hoped that the Khmer Rouge would be the patriotic saviors of Cambodia. In Stay Alive, My Son, Pin Yathay provides an unforgettable testament of the horror that ensued and a gripping account of personal courage, sacrifice and survival. Documenting the 27 months from the arrival of the Khmer Rouge in Phnom Penh to his escape into Thailand, Pin Yathay is a powerful and haunting memoir of Cambodia's killing fields. With seventeen members of his family, Pin Yathay were evacuated by the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh, taking with them whatever they might need for the three days before they would be allowed to return to their home. Instead, they were moved on from camp to camp, their possessions confiscated or abandoned. As days became weeks and weeks became months, they became the "New People," displaced urban dwellers compelled to live and work as peasants, their days were filled with forced manual labor and their survival dependent on ever more meager communal rations. The body count mounted, first as malnutrition bred rampant disease and then as the Khmer Rouge singled out the dissidents for sudden death in the darkness. Eventually, Pin Yathay's family was reduced to just himself, his wife, and their one remaining son, Nawath. Wracked with pain and disease, robbed of all they had owned, living on the very edge of dying, they faced a future of escalating horror. With Nawath too ill to travel, Pin Yathay and his wife, Any, had to make the heart-breaking decision whether to leave him to the care of a Cambodian hospital in order to make a desperate break for freedom. "Stay alive, my son," he tells Nawath before embarking on a nightmarish escape to the Thai border. First published in 1987, the Cornell edition of Stay Alive, My Son includes an updated preface and epilogue by Pin Yathay and a new foreword by David Chandler, a world-renowned historian of Cambodia, who attests to the continuing value and urgency of Pin Yathay's message.

 id : 245962 ISBN : 0517174391  | name : Moo  |  description : "DELECTABLY ENTERTAINING. . . . An uproariously funny and at the same time hauntingly melancholy portrait of a college community in the Midwest." --The New York Times Nestled in the heart of the Midwest, amid cow pastures and waving fields of grain, lies Moo University, a distinguished institution devoted to the art and science of agriculture. Here, among an atmosphere rife with devious plots, mischievous intrigue, lusty liaisons, and academic one-upmanship, Chairman X of the Horticulture Department harbors a secret fantasy to kill the dean; Mrs. Walker, the provost's right hand and campus information queen, knows where all the bodies are buried; Timothy Nonahan, associate professor of English, advocates eavesdropping for his creative writing assignments; and Bob Carlson, a sophomore, feeds and maintains his only friend: a hog named Earl Butz. In this wonderfully written and masterfully plotted novel, Jane Smiley, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Thousand Acres, offers us a wickedly funny comedy that is also a darkly poignant slice of life. "FAST, HILARIOUS, AND HEARTBREAKING . . . Not for a minute does Moo lose its perfect satiric pitch or its pacing. . . . Don't skip a page, don't skip a paragraph. It's going to be on the final." --People "SMART, IRREVERENT, AND WICKEDLY TENDER . . . Moo suggests a mix of Tom Wolfe's wit and John Updike's satiny reach . . . Engaging." --The Boston Globe "ENTERTAINING . . . Displays a wicked wit and an unerring eye for American foibles . . . Stuffed with memorable characters, sparkling with deliciously acid humor, Moo is a rare bird in today's literary menagerie: a great read that also makes you think." --Chicago Sun-Times "From the Trade Paperback edition.

 id : 245970 ISBN : 0884118975  | name : Voyage of the Damned  |  description : On May 13, 1939, the luxury liner "St. Louis" sailed from Hamburg, one of the last ships to leave Nazi Germany before World War II erupted. Aboard were 937 Jews--some had already been in concentration camps--who believed they had bought visas to enter Cuba. The voyage of the damned had begun.Before the "St. Louis" was halfway across the Atlantic, a power struggle ensued between the corrupt Cuban immigration minister who issued the visas and his superior, President Bru. The outcome: The refugees would not be allowed to land in Cuba.In America, the Brown Shirts were holding Nazi rallies in Madison Square Garden; anti-Semitic Father Coughlin had an audience of fifteen million. Back in Germany, plans were being laid to implement the final solution. And aboard the "St. Louis," 937 refugees awaited the decision that would determine their fate.Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts have re-created history in this meticulous reconstruction of the voyage of the "St. Louis." Every word of their account is true: the German High Command's ulterior motive in granting permission for the "mission of mercy;" the confrontations between the refugees and the German crewmen; the suicide attempts among the passengers; and the attitudes of those who might have averted the catastrophe, but didn't.In reviewing the work, the "New York Times" was unequivocal: "An extraordinary human document and a suspense story that is hard to put down. But it is more than that. It is a modern allegory, in which the SS "St. Louis" becomes a symbol of the SS "Planet Earth." In this larger sense the book serves a greater purpose than mere drama."

 id : 246037 ISBN : 0684832119  | name : Good News About High Blood Pressure  |  description : Here is the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and helpful book of its kind ever published for the fifty million Americans who suffer from high blood pressure, or hypertension. An internationally acclaimed authority, Dr. Thomas Pickering is Professor of Medicine at the Hypertension Center at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York. He is a leading researcher and educator, and the author of over 350 scientific articles and three clinical textbooks. Reflecting all the latest cutting-edge research, Good News about High Blood Pressure explains new technological breakthroughs such as ambulatory monitoring, the best mainstream treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and the pros and cons of alternative treatments such as vitamins, herbs, and meditation. Dr. Pickering reminds us that people suffering from hypertension do not necessarily exhibit any visible signs of stress or strain. In fact, in the vast majority of cases, hypertension produces no symptoms whatsoever, which is what makes it so deadly. This "invisible disease," which plagues its victims for life, can lead to heart disease and strokes -- the nation's leading causes of death and disability. The bad news is that just 65% of hypertension sufferers are aware of their condition, and only 49% are undergoing treatment. But the good news is that there are many new treatment options available that enable these people to keep their illness in check and live long and fruitful lives. With over twenty-five years' experience in answering patients' questions about their condition, Dr. Pickering shows hypertension patients how to take charge of their situation by learning to monitor their own blood pressure and by making appropriate changes in their lifestyle. In order to control high blood pressure, he emphasizes, one must deal with the other risk factors for heart disease, such as smoking, excess weight, and high cholesterol. Accessible and informative, the book discusses recently released studies about the possible impact on high blood pressure of red wine, homocysteine, the obesity hormone leptin, and folic acid. With its reassuring tone, comprehensive scope, and new research, Good News about High Blood Pressure encourages readers to take charge of their condition, rendering all other patient guides obsolete. It is about as close as a book can come to being an expert medical specialist on call to answer your questions twenty-four hours a day.

Female of the Species takes a step towards quantifying and understanding these cultural differences by looking at the changing roles women have played in society over time.

Barzini is startlingly frank as he examines "the two Italies": the one that created and nurtured such luminaries as Dante Alighieri, St. Thomas of Aquino, and Leonardo da Vinci; the other, feeble and prone to catastrophe, backward in political action if not in thought, "invaded, ravaged, sacked, and humiliated in every century." Deeply ambivalent, Barzini approaches his task with a combination of love, hate, disillusion, and affectionate paternalism, resulting in a completely original, thoughtful, and probing picture of his countrymen.

 id : 246076 ISBN : 0738202517  | name : Out Of Its Mind  |  description : Should psychiatrists treat the mind or the brain? Battles about this have plagued psychiatry at least since the end of the nineteenth century, when Sigmund Freud rejected science in favor of psychoanalysis. But now, 100 years later, we find the pendulum has swung the other way-toward over-dependence on psychoactive drugs and depersonalized psychiatry. In this important book, Harvard psychiatrist J. Allan Hobson and science journalist Jonathan Leonard explore the roots of this trend and propose the development of a more balanced "humanistic" psychiatry that-while remaining wary of "pill-pushing"-embraces rather than shuns neuroscience. For as Hobson and Leonard demonstrate, neuroscience has revolutionized our understanding of the mind, has shed a bright light on mental ills, and now stands ready to bridge the gap between biomedicine and psychotherapy. This is a vital step, they assert, if we are to revive today's flagging over-drugged psychiatry, provide sound care for millions of the neglected mentally ill, and realize humanity's ancient dream of treating not just the mind or brain alone, but both together.

 id : 246146 ISBN : 0452254337  | name : Lives of Girls and Women  |  description : The only novel from Alice Munro-award-winning author of The Love of a Good Woman--is an insightful, honest book, "autobiographical in form but not in fact," that chronicles a young girl's growing up in rural Ontario in the 1940's. Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.

 id : 246163 ISBN : 0195069552  | name : The Quest for El Cid  |  description : Rodrigo Díaz, the legendary warrior-knight of eleventh-century Castile known as El Cid, is still honored in Spain as a national hero for liberating the fatherland from the occupying Moors. Yet, as this book reveals, there are many contradictions between eleventh-century reality and the mythology that developed later. By placing El Cid in a fresh, historical context, Fletcher shows us an adventurous soldier of fortune who was of a type, one of a number of "cids," or "bosses," who flourished in eleventh-century Spain. But the El Cid of legend--the national hero -- was unique in stature even in his lifetime. Before his death El Cid was already celebrated in a poem; posthumously he was immortalized in the great epic Poema de Mío Cid. When he died in Valencia in 1099, he was ruler of an independent principality he had carved for himself in Eastern Spain. Rather than the zealous Christian leader many believe him to have been, Rodrigo emerges in Fletcher's study as a mercenary equally at home in the feudal kingdoms of northern Spain and the exotic Moorish lands of the south, selling his martial skills to Christian and Muslim alike. Indeed, his very title derives from the Arabic word sayyid, meaning 'lord' or 'master.' And as there was little if any sense of Spanish nationhood in the eleventh century, he can hardly be credited for uniting a medieval Spanish nation. This ground-breaking inquiry into the life and times of El Cid disentangles fact from myth to create a striking portrait of an extraordinary man, clearly showing how and why legend transformed him into something he was not during his lifetime.--From publisher description.

 id : 246170 ISBN : 0029291003  | name : Japanese Manufacturing Techniques  |  description : Japanese productivity and quality standards have fired the imagination of American managers, but until now there has been little explanation of how to do it -- how to apply Japanese methods at the actual operating level of U.S. manufacturing plants. This book shows you how, exposing otherwise well-informed westernized readers to a new world of management ideas. Author Richard J. Schonberger demonstrates that the Japanese formula for success is based on a number of specific, interrelated techniques -- stunning in their simplicity -- and he shows how these techniques can be put to work in American industries today. Here, in a clear, handbook format, are nine "lessons" for American manufacturers, introducing scores of techniques aimed at simplifying the overly-complex purchasing, inventory, assembly-fine, and quality-control processes of U.S. firms. At the heart of Japanese manufacturing success are two overlapping strategies: "just-in-time" production and "total quality control." Some American manufacturers already know a little about these methods, but Richard Schonberger provides the most comprehensive description of these techniques available: how they developed, how they all fit together, why they are so potent, and how they "snowball" -- unleashing a powerful chain reaction of productivity and quality control improvements each time more simplification is introduced. -- Publisher description.

 id : 246224 ISBN : 0385267649  | name : The Untouched Key  |  description : Drawing on her discoveries that human beings are not innately destructive but are made that way, the bestselling author of The Drama of the Gifted Child delivers "a capsule social history of childrearing and its effects that could change the world" (Boston Globe). As in her former books, Alice Miller again focuses on facts. She is as determined as ever to cut through the veil that, for thousands of years now, has been so meticulously woven to shroud the truth. When she lifts that veil and brushes it aside, the results are astonishing, amply demonstrated by her analyses of the works of Nietzsche, Picasso, Käthe Kollwitz, Buster Keaton, and others. With the key shunned by so many for so longchildhoodshe opens rusty locks and offers her readers a wealth of unexpected perspectives. What did Picasso express in Guernica? Why did Buster Keaton never smile? Why did Nietzsche heap so much opprobrium on women and religion and lose his mind for 11 years? Why did Hitler and Stalin become tyrannical mass murderers?

 id : 246251 ISBN : 0874770858  | name : Joy's Way, a Map for the Transformational Journey  |  description : In 1974 Dr. W. Brugh Joy was a distinguished and respected member of the Los Angeles medical community. In that year he contracted a life-threatening disease that culminated in an illuminating meditation, which caused him to give up his medical practice abruptly. Six weeks later he discovered that his illness was totally cured. This experience pushed him to further his explorations into realms of healing involving body energies, the chakra system, meditation, and higher levels of consciousness. In part, Joys Way is the story of an extraordinary personal transformation. More significantly, it is a book that shows vividly the process of individual and group transformation and that rattles and re-forms the reader's concepts of the nature of reality. It expands our vision of our own unrealized potential to be conscious beings who are alert to multiple realities, and introduces us to the seemingly miraculous abilities associated with energy fields radiating from the human body. Joys Way contains fascinating and beautiful insights into the awakening process, into teachers (inner and outer), psi phenomena, the holographic aspects of consciousness, observer and witness states, dream analysis, the Tarot and I Ching, visualization, the chakras, meditation and healing, transformational psychology, and the transformation of humanity. In addition, this book clearly describes exercises and techniques that show readers how to feel the radiating body-energy fields and how to transfer this energy to another person.

 id : 246259 ISBN : 0141439505  | name : Pygmalion  |  description : Exclusive to Penguin Classics: the definitive text of Shaws brilliantly witty exposure of the British class systempart of the official Bernard Shaw Library A Penguin Classic Shaw wrote the part of Eliza Doolittlean east-end dona with an apron and three orange and red ostrich feathersfor Mrs. Patrick Campbell, with whom he had a passionate but unconsummated affair. From the outset the play was a sensational success, although Shaw, irritated by its popularity at the expense of his artistic intentions, dismissed it as a potboiler. The Pygmalion of legend falls in love with his perfect female statue and persuades Venus to bring her to life so that he can marry her. But Shaw radically reworks Ovids tale to give it a feminist slant: while Higgins teaches Eliza to speak and act like a duchess, she also asserts her independence, adamantly refusing to be his creation. This Penguin Classics edition is the definitive text produced under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence, with an illuminating introduction by Nicholas Grene, discussing the language and politics of the play. Included in this volume is Shaws preface, as well as his sequel written for the first publication in 1916, to rebut public demand for a more conventionally romantic ending. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.

The Third Person the Divine Trinity, the Holy Ghost in Christian terminology, is so crucial to our approach to life that the wonder is the relatively inconspicuous position it has held in Christian dogma. A priest in the Liberal Catholic Church, J. J. Van der Leeuw was in modern terminology, an ecumenical Christian, relating religious concepts from all times and places to the inner teachings of Jesus.

 id : 246287 ISBN : 0679440526  | name : Cuba and the Night  |  description : "The setting is Cuba now, a place of yearnings, a strange place. Its economy wrecked, its revolution gone sour, its isolation almost complete, it lives largely on hopes and dreams - of sex, of money, of escape to America, Europe, anywhere. In this atmosphere of intense eroticism and frustration a love story develops, one as odd, abandoned, and ambiguous as Cuba itself." "Richard is an American news photographer at an emotional dead end, who has made it through life largely on bravado and a policy of noncommitment. In Havana on assignment, he meets, and at first scarcely notices, a vivacious young cubana named Lourdes, who may - or may not - be in search of a foreigner who can help her get out. Gradually, amid a confusion of motives, the two are drawn together in a passionate affair whose poignant outcome surprises both of them - and us." "This is Pico Iyer's first novel. Viewed purely as a rich, pungent, and unusually intimate description of the daily life and death of Havana, with its frequent electrical blackouts and ubiquitous secret police, it could only be the work of the author of Video Night in Kathmandu and Falling Off the Map. But it is far more. Pico Iyer here also shows himself capable of telling a wonderful story - romantic yet witty, deeply affecting yet delicately ironic, and completely convincing. Cuba and the Night is a delight."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc. All Rights Reserved

 id : 246314 ISBN : 0812814584  | name : The Descent of Woman  |  description : 'The Descent of Woman' is a pioneering work, the first to argue for the equal role of women in human evolution.

Elaine Morgan has made the 'Aquatic Ape Hypothesis' a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and 'The Descent of Woman' first set out an understanding of who humans are and where they come from.

These are beautiful and poignant stories unified by the powerful themes of deception and discontent.

A contemporary journalist writing in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, he gives a gripping record of the events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally seized power. Containing verbatim reports both of speeches by leaders and the chance comments of bystanders, set against an idealized backcloth of the proletariat, soldiers, sailors, and peasants uniting to throw off oppression, Reed's account is the product of passionate involvement and remains an unsurpassed classic of reporting.

 id : 246341 ISBN : 1570620776  | name : Letters to Vanessa  |  description : The world we inhabit is enchantedevery tree, rock, and star, and even "empty" space itself, is teeming with living energy and awareness. And it's all nearer to us than our own breath. Why, then, can't we see it? Because, according to Jeremy Hayward, we are taught not to. And because our cultural conditioning keeps us in denial about the fact that a strictly scientific worldview provides only a partial, and unsatisfactory, view of reality. Letters to Vanessa is the guidebook for a generation caught in the crunch between the hard realities of science and the genuine yearning for an experience of the sacred. In a series of letters addressed to his teenage daughter, Dr. Hayward points the way past the limits of science and shows how we can connect with the magical, multidimensional universe of soul. Along the way he presents the most recent findings of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, new biology, and physics in a most engaging and understandable way. He also provides practical meditation instructions that will enable everyone to reconnect with the joyous reality of ordinary life.

Jones seriesjust right for readers of Frindle, Love That Dog, The Lemonade War, and other classic young middle grade favorites. Kids arent supposed to die. Phoebes brother, Mick, was one of the funniest, coolest kids youd ever meetthe kid who made you laugh until your stomach hurt, even if you were mad at him. The kid who freaked his and Phoebes mom out by putting a ceramic eye in a defrosted chicken; who went trick-or-treating as Thomas Crapper, the inventor of the modern-day flush toilet; who did a wild solo dance in front of the entire school. He was the kid youd want to be friends with. So how can he be gone? And how will Phoebes family survive without him? Winner of 12 State Awards!

 id : 246360 ISBN : 0393039331  | name : Auschwitz, 1270 to the Present  |  description : Auschwitz, 1270 to the Present elucidates how the prewar ordinary town of Auschwitz became Germany's most lethal killing site step by step and in stages: a transformation wrought by human beings, mostly German and mostly male. Who were the men who conceived, created, and constructed the killing facility? What were they thinking as they inched their way to iniquity? Using the hundreds of architectural plans for the camp that the Germans, in their haste, forgot to destroy, as well as blueprints and papers in municipal, provincial, and federal archives, Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt show that the town of Auschwitz and the camp of that name were the centerpiece of Himmler's ambitious project to recover the German legacy of the Teutonic Knights and Frederick the Great in Nazi-ruled Poland. Analyzing the close ties between the 700-year history of the town and the five-year evolution of the concentration camp in its suburbs, Dwork and van Pelt offer an absolutely new and compelling interpretation of the origins and development of the death camp at Auschwitz. And drawing on oral histories of survivors, memoirs, depositions, and diaries, the authors explore the ever more murderous impact of these changes on the inmates' daily lives.

 id : 246367 ISBN : 087975737X  | name : Dancing Naked in the Material World  |  description : Dancing Naked in the Material World, a unique and illuminating photo-documentary, allows us to look beyond the exotic, sometimes grimy surface of the world of striptease and into the lives of the women who perform there. The dancers, whose humanity and intelligence is graciously depicted in Marilyn Futterman's brilliant black-and-white photographs, describe in their own words how they feel about themselves, their marginal profession, and the men who support it. How does such a sexual, competitive occupation affect the self-esteem of these women? What are their fears, hopes, and ambitions? Futterman, after deciding to do a photographic series on strippers, became a waitress in one of the clubs in Atlanta, Georgia. Working with and interviewing the dancers enabled her to better understand their diverse and complex lives. She witnessed first-hand the strippers' working environment, the people met there, and the relationships between the women. Men go to these clubs seeking fantasy for a dollar with no threat of intimacy. And the women achieve a kind of emotional fulfillment that is remarkably harder to find outside the doors of the club. Dancing Naked's poignant depiction of this odd social contract is important cultural history, vivid autobiography, and beautiful photography.

 id : 246373 ISBN : 0140439161  | name : The Bounty Mutiny  |  description : The names William Bligh, Fletcher Christian, and the Bounty have excited the popular imagination for more than two hundred years. The story of this famous mutiny has many beginnings and many endings but they all intersect on an April morning in 1789 near the island known today as Tonga. That morning, William Bligh and eighteen surly seamen were expelled from the Bounty and began what would be the greatest open-boat voyage in history, sailing some 4,000 miles to safety in Timor. The mutineers led by Fletcher Christian sailed off into a mystery that has never been entirely resolved. While the full story of what drove the men to revolt or what really transpired during the struggle may never be known, Penguin Classics has brought together-for the first time in one volume-all the relevant texts and documents related to a drama that has fascinated generations. Here is the full text of Bligh's Narrative of the Mutiny, the minutes of the court proceedings gathered by Edward Christian in an effort to clear his brother's name, and the highly polemic correspondence between Bligh and Christian-all amplified by Robert Madison's illuminating Introduction and rich selection of subsequent Bounty narratives. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

 id : 246429 ISBN : 0812579674  | name : The Elk-Dog Heritage  |  description : Don Coldsmith, inducted into the Writer's Hall of Fame of America and voted one of the Greatest Western Writers of the Twentieth Century by the Western Writers of America, is one of our national treasures. He single-handedly revolutionized the Western novel with his acclaimed Spanish Bit Saga, which has more than six million copies in print. Set in the early sixteenth century, the Spanish Bit Saga re-creates a time, a place, and a people that have been nearly lost to history. In it we see history in the making through the proud eyes of those who lived it. In the recent past, the People lived in fear, constantly pursued by their ancient enemies, the Head Splitters. But that was before Spaniard Juan Garcia arrived, bringing horses-Elk-Dogs. He taught his adopted people to ride and fight, to defy death and be victorious. Slowly, at first, they learned the ways of the magnificent animals that Garcia brought them. Soon, none could stand against them, and the once cowering and timid People became lords of the American Great Plains. The Head Splitters were defeated and now the People live a life of peace and prosperity. But not all are satisfied with peace. Eager to prove their manhood, the youths of the tribe long for the days of war. Against the direct orders of their elders, the young bloods seek out the Head Splitters and, waging their own war, place the entire tribe in jeopardy.

 id : 246476 ISBN : 0679438084  | name : Titan  |  description : John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--history's first billionaire and the patriarch of America's most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow, the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families, gives us a history of the mogul "etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed, balanced, and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller's exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations, the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist. Born the son of a flamboyant, bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious, straitlaced mother, Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world's richest man by creating America's most powerful and feared monopoly, Standard Oil. Branded "the Octopus" by legions of muckrakers, the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America. Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation's history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay. While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller's misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating, complex man, synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals, tragedies, and misfortunes that have never before come to light. John D. Rockefeller's story captures a pivotal moment in American history, documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Jay Gould, William Vanderbilt, Ida Tarbell, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Jung, J. Pierpont Morgan, William James, Henry Clay Frick, Mark Twain, and Will Rogers, Titan turns Rockefeller's life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is Ron Chernow's signal triumph that he narrates this monumental saga with all the sweep, drama, and insight that this giant subject deserves. From the Hardcover edition.

Her mother Nora, long divorced from Ruby's father, is a woman whose past is just about to catch up with her - in the form of blackmail by a former lover. After an accident (an attempted suicide?) Ruby returns to care for her stricken mother - bitterly resenting the fact that once again her mother's life has colonized hers. When she is approached by a publisher to write a biography of her mother, Ruby is desperate for the princely sum offered. Yet her research into her mother's past reveals a woman very different from the one Ruby expected. And what began as "mommy dearest" ends as a love story - not only between mother and daughter, but involving two very different men who play a key role in linking the past to the present.

 id : 246487 ISBN : 074323815X  | name : 21 Dog Years  |  description : In 1998, when Amazon.com began to recruit employees, they gave temp agencies a simple directive: send us your freaks. Mike Daisey -- slacker, onetime aesthetics major -- fit the bill. His subsequent ascension, over the course of twenty-one dog years, from lowly temp to customer service representative to business development hustler is the stuff of both dreams and nightmares. Here, with lunatic precision, Daisey describes lightless cube farms in which book orders were scrawled on Post-its while technicians struggled to bring computers back online, as well as fourteen-hour days fueled by caffeine, fanaticism, and illicit day-trading from office desks made out of doors. You'll meet Warren, the cowboy of customer service, capable of verbally hog-tying even the most abusive customer; Amazon employee #5, a computer gamer who spends at least six hours a day locked in his office killing goblins but is worth a cool $300 million; and Jean-Michele, Daisey's girlfriend and sparring partner, who tries to keep him grounded, even as dot-com mania seduces them both. Punctuated by Daisey's hysterically honest fictional missives to CEO Jeff Bezos, 21 Dog Years is an epic story of greed, self-deception, and heartbreak -- a wickedly funny anthem to an era of bounteous stock options and boundless insanity.

 id : 246527 ISBN : 0815604718  | name : The Night Has a Naked Soul  |  description : In a work that spans nearly two centuries, anthropologist Alan Kilpatrick explores the occult world of the Western Cherokee, expounding on previously collected documents and translating some forty new shamanistic texts that have never been disclosed to outside audiences. For over a hundred and fifty years, the Cherokee Indians have been recording their medico-magical traditions in the native script of the Sequoyah syllabary.

 id : 246529 ISBN : 0875425917  | name : The Family Wicca Book  |  description : Chances are good that you are either part of a family or hope to be part of a family some day. And if you're a Wiccan, you realize how challenging it can be to raise a Wiccan family in a non-Pagan world. Now you can learn strategies to deal with these challenges in The Family Wicca Book by Ashleen O'Gaea. Ashleen has been married for almost twenty years and has a son who is twelve. She speaks from experience, not just theory. As an award-winning Pagan journalist, she presents her insights and experiences in a way that is fun and interesting. All families have good times and difficult times. This book covers both, and presents rituals and rites your family can do together. It includes simple rituals and magic so even young children can see the results for themselves. It gives samples of festivals from the Wiccan "Wheel of the Year" in formats that children can participate in and enjoy. Perhaps the greatest gift of this book is in the way it will show you how to deal with difficult situations. First, it offers advice on answering the difficult questions that children ask, and doing so from a Wiccan point of view. When a child asks "Why am I alive?" or "Why do bad things happen to people?" you will have answers that are profound yet make sense to kids. The outside world may also present child-raising challenges. How do you answer your children's friends' questions about your religion? What do you tell your child when he or she asks why some people think you're Satanists? And how do you influence your children to follow a life-affirming, harmonious, Wiccan path when the entire world seems to be focused on different things, from school to TV? The answers of one Wiccan mother are in this book. You can use her knowledge and experience to inform your answers.

Cada uno de aquellos granos era un pecado mortal, según le decía el confesor. El sentido de la culpa no podía desligarlo del placer y éste era la hierba quemada de verano, el sonido de la resaca en la playa bajo el cañizo ofuscado por la luz del arenal. Sobre un fondo de crímenes famosos en aquella Valencia todavía huertana de los años cincuenta se desarrolla la conciencia del protagonista. EL crimen de la envenenadora, el garrote vil a aquel esquizofrénico que asesinó y cubrió de flores a la niña antes de depositarla en una acequia, la aparición de las piernas depiladas de un hombre con la uñas pintadas dentro de un saco: a través de esta geografía de la memoria un tranvía con jardinera cruzaba la ciudad y se dirigía a la playa de la Malvarrosa. En ese espacio olvidó el protagonista la neurosis del padre, la tortura de una educación religiosa, la sordidez social de aquel tiempo. Desde el fondo de la adolescencia llegó a Valencia un día en que todos los escaparates de las pastelerías exhibían la imagen del general Franco confeccionada a base de frutas confitadas. Cualquier héroe tiene que hacer un viaje para encontrarse a sí mismo. El viaje de iniciación entre la adolescencia y la juventud el protagonista de este relato lo realiza en un tranvía hacia la playa de la Malvarrosa, donde la libertad fue conquistada y la inocencia quedó atrás junto con el bañador olvidado bajo un arbusto de adelfas.

 id : 246568 ISBN : 0465017568  | name : Holler If You Hear Me  |  description : Acclaimed for his writing on Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as his passionate defense of black youth culture, Michael Eric Dyson is known as the "hip-hop intellectual." With his Blackboard best seller Holler If You Hear Me, Dyson has reached his widest audience to date, bringing to life the hopes and dreams of slain hip-hop artist Tupac Shakur. Viewed by many as a "black James Dean," Tupac has attained cult status since his death six years ago, partly due to the posthumous release of several albums, three movies, and a collection of poetry. But Tupac lives on primarily because of the devotion of his loyal followers. Dyson helps us to understand why a twenty-five-year-old rapper, activist, poet, actor, and alleged sex offender looms even larger in death than he did in life. With his trademark skills of critical thinking and storytelling, Dyson examines the significance of Tupac Shakur for black youth, assessing the ways in which different elements of Shakur's persona-thug, confused prophet, fatherless child-are both vital and destructive. Deeply personal and sharply analytical at the same time, Dyson's book offers a wholly original way of looking at Tupac Shakur that will thrill those who already love the artist and enlighten those who want to understand him.

 id : 246620 ISBN : 0375753192  | name : Prostate Cancer  |  description : Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer (excluding skin cancer) among American men. In 1998 approximately 184,500 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in the United States. However, if detected early, it is also among the most treatable forms of cancer, and due to advances in diagnosis and treatment, survival rates continue to rise. The five-year survival rate has increased from 50 percent in the period from 1960 to 1963 to 89 percent today. But most men--and their families--lack the most basic information about what to do when confronted with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. This book, written by internationally respected medical experts, sets out to explain everything a man needs to know. Written, updated, and revised under the auspices of the American Cancer Society, the nation's leader in cancer research, education, and rehabilitation, it contains the most up-to-date information about the disease. Even more, it is a patient's advocacy book, offering medical, practical, psychological, social, and emotional support. Through case histories and anecdotes--and always with compassion--it addresses the full range of issues that men with the disease may face.

Breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers are the four most common cancers among women, with over 254,000 newly diagnosed cases in 1998. Recognizing that the survival rate is significantly higher when these diseases are detected early and treated appropriately, the American Cancer Society, the nation's leader in cancer research, education, and rehabilitation, and Dr. Carolyn D. Runowicz, Dr. Jeanne A. Petrek, and Dr. Ted S. Gansler, three of America's preeminent experts on breast, cervical, endo-metrial, and ovarian cancer and cancer education, have come together to write the most comprehensive resource for patients and their families to turn to. This book contains the most up-to-date information about these related diseases, from step-by-step advice about what to do when confronted with a diagnosis of one of these cancers to the latest medical facts, treatments, and procedures. Women and Cancer provides patients with the latest information about the risks and benefits of new drug therapies, radiation, and surgical procedures. But, most important, this book approaches the topic from the patient's perspective, providing psychological and emotional support throughout. Comprehensive and compassionate, with patient stories and anecdotes women will relate to and feel comfortable with, Women and Cancer addresses the full range of issues that women cancer patients and their families may face.

 id : 246645 ISBN : 2253096326  | name : Les filles du feu ; Petits châteaux de Bohême ; Promenades et souvenirs  |  description : " Même en dehors de Sylvie, il y a chez Nerval une infusion omniprésente du souvenir, une chanson du temps passé qui s'envole et qui se dévide à partir des rappels même les plus ténus de naguère comme de jadis, et que je ne vois à aucun autre écrivain. Ce n'est pas une résurrection quasi hallucinatoire du passé, comme il arrive aux meilleurs moments de Proust, tout proches parfois de l'illusion de la fausse reconnaissance, c'est plutôt, évoqué dans sa prose par quelque sortilège, le contact d'aveugle qu'on éprouve en retrouvant la maison et le jardin de son enfance. Comme si ce monde révolu était le seul endroit où, instinctivement, infailliblement Nerval se retrouve, et nous en convainc immédiatement. " Julien Gracq. Un tel monde révolu est ce qui définit au plus près les uvres ici réunies où se retrouve à la fois le " rêveur en prose " et le poète des Odelettes et des Chimères. Les Petits Châteaux recomposent les âges de Nerval; les Promenades et Souvenirs ne séparent pas le passé des lieux que l'écrivain traversa. Quant aux Filles du Feu, c'est sous le titre d'Amours perdues qu'il songea un moment à les publier. Comme souvent chez Nerval, ces différentes uvres ne cessent pas ainsi d'être une quête.

Bestselling authors H. Stephen Glenn and Jane Nelsen have helped hundreds of thousands of parents raise capable, independent children with Raising Self-Reliant Children in a Self-Indulgent World. On its tenth anniversary, this parenting classic returns with fresh, up-to-date information to offer you inspiring and workable ideas for developing a trusting relationship with children, as well as the skills to implement the necessary discipline to help your child become a responsible adult. Those who think in terms of leniency versus strictness will be surprised. This book goes beyond these issues to teach children to be responsible and self-reliantnot through outer-directed concerns, such as fear and intimidation, but through inner-directed behavior, such as feeling accountable for one's commitments. Inside, you'll discover how to instill character-building values and traits in your child that last a lifetime. "During these turbulent days when families are in disarray and children are getting the short end of the stick, this book can be very helpful to parents who are struggling to bring up self-reliant children. Even after raising five of my own and becoming a grandfather for the seventh time, I got some new ideas out of it!"Art Linkletter "An inspiring, workable formula for developing closeness, trust, dignity, and respect . . . a real gem."Becky Ridgeway, School Social Worker

 id : 246719 ISBN : 0449905896  | name : Earth Medicine--earth Food  |  description : Long before there was pharmacology as we know it, the North American Indians cured illness and maintained health by natural means, using the healing plants of the forest, desert, and seashore. Their discoveries continue to have impact on modern medicine: over 25 percent of all prescription drugs contain plant derivatives, and the mainstream medical establishment is acknowledging the effectiveness of herbal remedies in treating certain illnesses. Earth Medicine, Earth Food is an A-to-Z reference to the plant remedies and wild foods used by the Indians. Organized by condition -- from allergies to female complaints to wounds -- it explains which plants were used by different tribes to treat specific maladies, how they were prepared, and how to identify them in the wild. You'll learn that: -- The Catawba Indians treated back pain with a tea of arnica roots -- The Iroquois and Mohegans used the boneset weed for colds and fever -- The Blackfoot Indians applied a paste of scarlet mallow to burns as a cooling agent -- The Menominees cured insomnia with a tea steeped from the leaves of the partridge berry plant -- The Onondagas drank pennyroyal tea for headache Earth Medicine, Earth Food also discusses non-animal food sources consumed by the Indians such as nuts, seeds, berries, and ferns, and examines the relevance of traditional dietary patterns to the way we eat now. With over 160 detailed illustrations of plants as they are found in nature, Earth Medicine, Earth Food belongs on your shelf next to such works as Food and Healing Traditional Foods Are Your Best Medicine, and guides to Chinese medicine.

 id : 246723 ISBN : 0062512919  | name : The Valkyries  |  description : Drawing on work in critical theory, feminism and social history, this book traces the lines of tension shot through Victorian culture by the fear that the social world was being reduced to a display window behind which people, their actions and their convictions were exhibited for the economic appetites of others. Affecting the most basic elements of Victorian life - the vagaries of desire, the rationalisation of social life, the gendering of subjectivity, the power of nostalgia, the fear of mortality, the cyclical routines of the household - the ambivalence generated by commodity culture organizes the thematic concerns of these novels and the society they represent. Taking the commodity as their point of departure, chapters on Thackeray, Gaskell, Dickens, Eliot, Trollope, and the Great Exhibition of 1851 suggest that Victorian novels provide us with graphic and enduring images of the power of commodities to affect the varied activities and beliefs of individual and social experience.

 id : 246786 ISBN : 0060633166  | name : Story of Christianity: Volume 2  |  description : Beginning with the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, this second volume of The Story of Christianity continues narrative history to the present. Historian Justo Gonzalez brings to life the people, dramatic events, and shaping ideas of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy during this period, keynoting crucial theological developments while providing fresh understanding of the social, political, and economic forces that influenced the formation of the church. In particular, the author notes recurring themes of unrest, rebellion, and reformation. Gonzalez presents an illuminating record of the lives, impelling ideas, and achievements of such prominent figures as Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, and John Calvinmovers and shapers in the emerging Protestant church. His biographical insights, in conjunction with vivid historical accounts, reveal how individual lives mirror and clarify core theological concerns and developments. The interpretive overview of The Story of Christianity includes a thorough and timely analysis of the growth and maturation of Christianity, including events in Europe, the United States, and Latin Americathe latter an area too often neglected in church histories, yet increasingly vital to an understanding of Christianity's historical development, present situation, and future, options. Gonzalez's richly textured study discusses the changes and directions of the church in the traditions of Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Christianity. The Story of Christianity covers such recent occurrences as the World Council of Churches, the Second Vatican Council, the movement toward Christian unity, and much more. It concludes with a thoughtful look at the major issues and debates involving Christians today.

Über ein halbes Jahrhundert war die Gräfin das moralische Rückgrat, die seelische Achse der Wochenzeitung "Die Zeit". Zwei ihrer Wegbegleiter und engsten Vertrauten, Haug von Kuenheim und Theo Sommer, haben in den letzten Monaten ihres Lebens zahlreiche Gespräche mit ihr geführt. Noch einmal sagte sie, was ihr im Leben wichtig war und was sie weitergeben wollte an die Nachwelt. Wie hielt sie es mit der Religion? Was dachte sie über die Monarchie als Staatsform, über die noch immer unvollendete Demokratie in Deutschland? Gab es für sie ewige, unverrückbare Wahrheiten? Welche Spielregeln braucht die Gesellschaft, welche Normen ein Gemeinwesen? Es waren lange Gespräche, unterbrochen von Pausen, die die Krankheit erzwang: ein öffentliches Testament. Es blieb unvollendet; der Tod vereitelte den Abschluss. Dieses nachgelassene Buch nimmt auch die wichtigsten Texte aus ihren letzten Lebensjahren auf: Reden, Dankesworte, Aufzeichnungen. Es eröffnet Einblick in die letzten Gedanken einer eindrucksvollen Frau. Haug von Kuenheim arbeitete über Jahrzehnte verantwortlich in der "Zeit", Theo Sommer war viele Jahre Chefredakteur und Mitherausgeber der "Zeit".

But for distinguished Harvard economist Henry Spearman it offered diversion of a decidedly different sort and one hed hardly anticipated: murder. While the island police force is mired in an investigation that leads everywhere and nowhere, the diminutive, balding Spearman, who likes nothing better than to train his curiosity on human behavior, conducts an investigation of his own, one governed by rather different lawsthose of economics. Theorizing and hypothesizing, Spearman sets himself on the killers trail as it twists from the postcard-perfect beaches and manicured lawns of a resort to the bustling old port of Charlotte Amalie to densely forested hiking trails with perilous drops to a barren offshore cay.

 id : 246911 ISBN : 8432227706  | name : Fuera  |  description : Susanna Tamaro muestra con sobrecogedora emoción el lado más desasosegante de nuestra cotidianidad en estos relatos. Nabila, Salvación, Arik o Rossella son los protagonistas de estas páginas, pero en la vida real siempre son personajes secundarios, emigrantes procedentes de África, Filipinas o Cabo Verde que simbolizan la dificultad de comunicarnos y de vivir con la diversidad. «En nuestros itinerarios cotidianos encontramos muchos rostros. Rostros que pertenecen a mundos distintos y, con frecuencia, parecen incluso de distintas épocas. ¿Qué habrá detrás de esas miradas? La mayoría de las veces preferimos no hacernos preguntas. Dejarlos fuera. Fuera de nuestros pensamientos, fuera de nuestros sentimientos, y si es posible, fuera también de nuestro horizonte.»En un mundo trastornado por la cháchara mediática es difícil guardar silencio, es difícil escuchar y mirar, tratar de comprender quién soy yo, quién es el otro. Resulta más fácil aferrarnos a la primera opinión que se nos propone y llevarla puesta como se lleva una prenda de moda. Pero una opinión, más que un terreno sólido sobre el que confrontarse, es una ciénaga que tiende a uniformar la riqueza de la realidad en un limo grisáceo. ¿Y si debiéramos dejar fuera precisamente nuestras opiniones, nuestros prejuicios, nuestras barreras? ¿Y si el extranjero, en lugar de una amenaza, es una interrogación sobre nosotros mismos, sobre el sentido de nuestro estar en el mundo?» Susanna Tamaro

 id : 246940 ISBN : 0299164942  | name : The Other Mother  |  description : On a spring day in 1993, Nancy Abrams helped her daughter dress for day care, packed her lunch, and said good-bye. Next she drove to court, where she learned that in the eyes of the law she was nothing more than a biological stranger to the child she helped bring into the world and raise. That was the last time she would see her daughter or hear her voice for five years. The Other Mother begins as Abrams and her female lover decide to start a family together. With giddy anticipation, they search for a sperm donor, shop for baby clothes and crib, and attend childbirth classes. But despite their high hopes, the relationship begins to fall apart, and they separate when their daughter is a toddler. Problems between the two intensify until, shortly before her daughters fifth birthday, Abrams loses custody. In unprecedented depth, Abramss compelling narrative examines the social, legal, and political implications of gay and lesbian parenting. Her haunting memoir asks the question, What makes a mother? It is a question that biological parents, co-parents, adoptive parents, step-parents, and divorced parents must each answer in their own way. In telling one womans story, The Other Mother makes a solid case for legal protections, including marriage, for lesbian and gay families.

No lady would rove about the heath at all hours of the day and night as she does. But that's not all of it. There was something queer between her and Thomasin's husband at one time--I am as sure of it as that I stand here.' 'Eustacia has told me. He did pay her a little attention a year ago; but there's no harm in that. I like her all the better.' 'Clym, ' said his mother with firmness, 'I have no proofs against her, unfortunately. But if she makes you a good wife, there has never been a bad one. 'Believe me, you are almost exasperating, ' said Yeobright vehemently. 'And this very day I had intended to arrange a meeting between you. But you give me no peace; you try to thwart my wishes in everything.' 'I hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly I wish I had never lived to see this; it is too much for me--it is more than I thought ' She turned to the window. Her breath was coming quickly, and her lips were pale, parted, and trembling. 'Mother, ' said Clym, 'whatever you do, you will always be dear to me--that you know. 'But one thing I have a right to say, which is, that at my age I am old enough to know what is best for me.' Mrs. Yeobright remained for some time silent and shaken, as if she could say no more. Then she replied, 'Best? Is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that? Don't you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you? You give up your whole thought--you set your whole soul--to please a woman.' 'I do. And that woman is you.' 'How can you treat me so flippantly ' said his mother, turning again to him with a tearful look. 'You are unnatural, Clym, and I did not expect it.' 1 Very likely, ' said he cheerlessly. 'You did not know...
 id : 247018 ISBN : 0062507109  | name : Inner Bonding  |  description : Inner bonding is the process of connecting our adult thoughts with our instinctual, gut feelings -- the feelings of the "inner child" -- so that we can minimize painful conflict within ourselves. Free of inner conflict, we feel peaceful, open to joy, and open to giving and receiving love. Margaret Paul, coauthor of Healing Your Aloneness, explores how abandonment of the inner child leads to increasingly negative and destructive feelings of low self-worth, codepenclence, addiction, shame, powerlessness, and withdrawal from relationships. Her breakthrough inner bonding process teaches us to heal past wounds through reparenting and clearly demonstrates how we can learn to parent in the present. Real-life examples illustrate the dynamics of the healing process and show the benefits we can expect in every facet of our lives and in all our relationships. Inner Bonding provides the tools we need to forge and maintain the inner unity that makes our family, sexual, work, and social relationships productive, honest, and joyful.

 id : 247068 ISBN : 1570620970  | name : Zen Essence  |  description : The teachings presented here offer a new view of Zen Buddhism that may surprise some readers. In contrast to the popular image of Zen as being an authoritarian, monastic tradition deeply rooted in Asian culture, this collection of teachings portrays Zen as being remarkably flexible, adaptive to contemporary and individual needs, and transcending cultural boundaries. Because of the very nature of Zen, its essence does not belong to any particular culture or philosophy. Its practice requires consciousness alone and does not depend on a background in Zen Buddhism or Asian culture. The essence of Zen applies directly to the relationship between mind and culture, whatever that culture might be. Therefore it relates immediately to the way in which the world is experienced and life is lived. Drawn from the records of the great Chinese Zen masters of the Tang and Song dynasties, this collection represents the most open and direct forms of instruction in the entire Zen canon. What emerges is a picture of Zen, not as a religion or philosophy, but as a practical science of freedom. The translator provides a detailed afterword describing the historical and cultural background of the development of Chinese Zen.

 id : 247072 ISBN : 1852278099  | name : Your Life in Your Hands  |  description : One out of nine women in the United States will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. In fact, it is the second leading cause of cancer death for women (after lung cancer) and the leading overall cause of death in women between the ages of forty and fifty-five. For too long women have erroneously believed that there is little or nothing they can do to prevent this dread illness. Our major medical efforts are directed toward detecting and treating, rather than preventing, breast cancer. Professor Jane Plant, one of Britain's most eminent scientists, contracted breast cancer in 1987. She had five recurrences, and, by 1993, the cancer had spread to her lymph system. When orthodox medicine gave up and she was told that she only had three months to live, she determined to use her extensive scientific training and her knowledge of other cultures to find a way to survive. In her research, she was startled to find that in China breast cancer affects far fewer women than in Western countries. Plant considered that there could be a dietary trigger for the illness. As she continued her scientific investigations, she became convinced that there was a causal link between consumption of dairy products and breast cancer. Jane Plant finally defeated her breast cancer, in part because she used her training and knowledge as a natural scientist to understand it-- and then overcome it. Combining the diet her research had led to with traditional medical treatment, Professor Plant was not only able to triumph over her own disease but also to pass on what she had discovered to help more than sixty other women successfully fight their breast cancer. In this book, women will be presented for thefirst time with a compelling body of evidence strongly suggesting that consumption of dairy products may cause breast cancer. It will demonstrate the specific changes that women can make in their day-to-day lives to help prevent and treat breast cancer. With a clear statement of the scientific principles behind her discovery, Professor Plant includes detailed suggestions for ways to alter your diet by eliminating or reducing consumption of many suspected cancer-causing agents, especially dairy products, and replacing them with healthful alternatives. She offers as well detailed menus and recipes to help you make the transition and enjoy it. Your Life in Your Hands is a revolutionary book that will change the lives of millions of women.
 id : 247073 ISBN : 1930285000  | name : How to Develop a Powerful Prayer Life  |  description : Today there are rising signs that God is calling His people back to Himself through prayer and repentance.

 id : 247075 ISBN : 1583940790  | name : Fart Proudly  |  description : A mention of flatulence might conjure up images of bratty high school boys or lowbrow comics. But one of the most eloquentand least expectedcommentators on the subject is Benjamin Franklin. The writings in Fart Proudly reveal the rogue who lived peaceably within the philosopher and statesman. Included are "The Letter to a Royal Academy"; "On Choosing a Mistress"; "Rules on Making Oneself Disagreeable"; and other jibes. Franklin's irrepressible wit found an outlet in perpetrating hoaxes, attacking marriage and other sacred cows, and skewering the English Parliament. Reminding us of the humorous, irreverent side of this American icon, these essays endure as both hilarious satire and a timely reminder of the importance of a free press.

 id : 247080 ISBN : 0374523878  | name : The Odyssey  |  description : With its inspired counterpointing of Homeric and Caribbean themes, Derek Walcott's new play, commissioned by Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company, springs from the same imaginative sources as his epic poem Omeros.

Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, the giant Cyclops, Circe and her revellers, ghosts, and mermaids are among the cast. With its vast sweep and richly figurative language, The Odyssey confirms that Derek Walcott is as compelling a playwright as he is a poet.

And the special agent is the only one who realizes that it is not loyalty, or honor, or debt that drive the young man to murder -- but the thrill of the kill!

So they do, splendidly. There is the yarn about the innocent temptress from Biloxi and the odd revenge she takes on the man who steals her away. That one is topped by the tale of the fastest Jeep in the world and a deadly race in the Mexican foothills. A graduate student contributes a chiller about a pack of man-eating cats in his home town. When they are not swapping whoppers and case histories, the members of the troupe couple and uncouple in scenes that manage to be both erotic and clinically detached. Jealousies arise and a small epidemic of paranoia breaks out as opening night approaches.

Elevée à la cour comme toutes les maharani l'ont été avant elle, Djaya est capable de chasser le tigre comme de se consacrer avec mille raffinements aux rituels de la vie familiale ou conjugale. Bientôt cependant, le XXe siècle vient bouleverser cet ordre ancien, l'influence de l'Occident se faisant chaque jour plus agressive. Après la mort tragique de son père, le maharaja Jaï Singh, Djaya devra subir la loi d'un mari détestable qui, face à ses amis de l'aristocratie britannique, lui fera jouer le rôle avilissant d'objet exotique jusqu'au jour où, après bien des tragédies, enfin au pouvoir, elle fera le choix de la démocratie en embrassant la cause de Gandhi et Nehru.

Spencer urges us - gay and straight, bisexual transgendered - to reject a human-centered, anthropocentric worldview in favor of an ecocentric worldview. Yet our responses to the ecological crises need to be rooted in, and nourished by, our appreciation of the erotic.

 id : 247225 ISBN : 1410749029  | name : Step Off the Edge  |  description : Whatever Happened to Mother? traces the loss in human history of the biological nurturing mother that all children expect to have (in terms of their genetic inheritance) at birth. The book challenges the wisdom underlying contemporary infant care and child rearing by addressing such questions as: Are our conventional infant care and child rearing practices detrimental to children's development? Why do so many mothers no longer, or only minimally, mother their children? Why do we believe that nurturing children will spoil them? Why has bottle-feeding replaced nursing as the major way of feeding infants? Why has the abuse of children been tolerated throughout centuries of civilization? Why does our society have so many emotionally and socially deviant individuals? The book is written in a narrative style in simple language, which makes it suitable for older children as well as adults. Underlying the story it tells is Dr. Kimmel's sound knowledge of child development, anthropology, the history of childcare, and the difficulties mothers (and fathers) today face in caring for their children. His message is an invitation to readers to question their own, and our societal, parental practices. 'A wonderfully fresh perspective on the issue of mothering in contemporary society. Everyone should read it.' -Elliott Barker, M.D., Director, The Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 'Dr. Kimmel sheds some new light on the components of a healthy mother-child relationship, in a book that is easy to read, yet packed with sound theory and rationale.' -Exerpt fron a book review.

Reviewed by Jeannine Parvati Baker, author of Prenatal Yoga & Natural Birth, Hygieia: A Woman's Herbal and, with Frederick Baker, Conscious Conception: Elemental Journey Through The Labyrinth Of Sexuality. 'Kimmel's easy to read style, simple language and uncomplicated presentation makes this a book that could be read not only by parents, but by growing teenagers. He touches on thoughts and ideas that many nurturing parents have, but seldom see in print.' -Marnie Ko, Editor and Publisher, Nurturing Magazine

 id : 247240 ISBN : 076791404x  | name : She's Not There  |  description : The exuberant memoir of a man named James who became a woman named Jenny.Shes Not Thereis the story of a person changing genders, the story of a person bearing and finally revealing a complex secret; above all, it is a love story. By turns funny and deeply moving, Jennifer Finney Boylan explores the remarkable territory that lies between men and women, examines changing friendships, and rejoices in the redeeming power of family.Shes Not Thereis a portrait of a loving marriagethe love of James for his wife, Grace, and, against all odds, the enduring love of Grace for the woman who becomes her sister, Jenny. To this extraordinary true story, Boylan brings the humorous, fresh voice that won her accolades as one of the best comic novelists of her generation. With her distinctive and winning perspective,Shes Not Thereexplores the dramatic outward changes and unexpected results of life as a woman: Jenny fights the urge to eat salad, while James consumed plates of ribs; gone is the stability of one damn mood, all the damn time. While Boylans own secret was unusual, to say the least, she captures the universal sense of feeling uncomfortable, out of sorts with the world, and misunderstood by her peers. Jenny is supported on her journey by her best friend, novelist Richard Russo, who goes from begging his friend to Be a man (in every sense of the word) to accepting her as an attractive, buoyant woman. The most unexpected thing, Russo writes in his Afterword to the book, is in how Jennys story we recognize our shared humanity. As James evolves into Jennifer in scenes that are by turns tender, startling, and witty, a marvelously human perspective emerges on issues of love, sex, and the fascinating relationship between our physical and our intuitive selves. Through the clear eyes of a truly remarkable woman,Shes Not Thereprovides a new window on the often confounding process of accepting ourselves.

Stovic is hailed as a hero, and he sees this as the perfect moment to help him achieve his life-long dream -- flying with the world-famous Blue Angels, the Navy's elite flight demonstration team. Ismael Nezzar, the brother of the deceased Algerian pilot, is in the U.S. on a student visa. He sees the boastful Stovic on the Today show and is enraged by his glibness. While attending his brother's funeral -- the biggest event in Algeria in a decade -- Ismael is coerced by a group of Islamic radicals to seek revenge for his brother's death. Though he withdrew from the powerful group years before, Ismael is filled with fury and will stop at nothing to destroy Stovic. Unknown to either of these two men, Kent Rathman has been assigned by a highly placed government official to watch them. Working in the shadows, Rat moves easily among government agencies and is ordered by his White House contacts -- including the President and the NSA director, who has plans to bring about a change of power on her own -- to stop the Algerian. To save his country and his friend, Rat must devise a brilliant counterstrike -- a mission in which failure means certain death. Packed with deadly intrigue, Beltway power plays, and high-flying adventure, The Shadows of Power is Huston's most exciting novel yet.

 id : 247279 ISBN : 0805060251  | name : Easy Money  |  description : For the readers who put Deja Dead at the top, a gritty, gratifying debut.

And outside of Seattle a young woman arrives in a dimly-lit bar to pick up a computer disk wrapped in a white handkerchief.

Suddenly Allie is on the run. Someone is setting her up to take the fall. Someone who knows what's on the disk. Someone who will stop at nothing to conceal the evidence of a horrific crime. Reaching back to uncover a brilliantly concealed operation during the Vietnam War, ducking into drug dens, spiraling through seedy strip joints, and blazing across the country, Jenny Siler weaves a devastating tale of death and deception in her dazzling debut.
 id : 247280 ISBN : 0875847706  | name : The Art of Possibility  |  description : In their playing you hear not only precision, color and balance, but thunder, lightning and the language of the heart. This is what the Boston Globe said about a performance by conductor Benjamin Zander with the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, but it could apply equally to the Zanders' inspirational book, the product of a synthesis of the diverse worlds of the symphony orchestra and cutting-edge psychology. The Art of Possibility offers a set of breakthrough practices for creativity in all human enterprises. Infused with the energy of their dynamic partnership, the book joins together Ben's extraordinary talent as a mover and shaker, teacher, and communicator, with Rosamund Stone Zander's genius for creating innovative paradigms for personal and professional fulfillment. In lively counterpoint, the authors provide us with a deep sense of the powerful role that the notion of possibility can play in every aspect of our lives. The Zanders' deceptively simple practices are based on two premises: that life is composed as a story ("it's all invented") and that, with new definitions, much more is possible than people ordinarily think. The book shifts our perspective with uplifting stories, parables, and anecdotes from the authors' personal experiences as well as from famous and everyday heroes. From "Giving an A," to the mysterious "Rule Number 6," to "Leading from Any Chair"-the account of Ben's stunning realization that the conductor/leader's power is directly linked to how much greatness he is willing to grant to others-each practice offers an opportunity for personal and organizational transformation. The Art of Possibility provides a life-altering approach to fulfilling dreams large and small. The Zanders invite us all to become passionate communicators, leaders, and performers whose lives radiate possibility into the world. Rosamund Stone Zander is a family therapist and a landscape painter. Benjamin Zander is the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and a professor at the New England Conservatory of Music. Based on the principles developed through the authors' unique partnership, Mr. Zander gives presentations to managers and executives around the world and Ms. Zander conducts workshops for organizations on practicing the art of possibility.

Però, a més a més, Vals és també el resultat de lesforç per fer una novel·la més pròpia del nostre segle que no pas deutora dels estàndards del precedent. Allunyada del realisme del segle XIX, sens mostra encara als nostres dies amb el valor no caducat de la modernitat. El 1936 li va ser concedit el premi Crexells.

 id : 247391 ISBN : 0060176555  | name : Homebody  |  description : From a beloved and bestselling master of speculative fiction comes this chilling tale of a soulful loner who must overcome demons from his past -- and the demons he unwittingly unleashes -- when he starts renovating a faded Southern mansion. As Homebody eloquently proves, no contemporary writer outshines Orson Scott Card in crafting unlikely heroes or in suffusing the everyday world with an otherworldly glow. Don Lark's cheery name belies his tragic past. When his alcoholic ex-wife killed their daughter in a car wreck, he retreated from the sort of settled, sociable lifestyle one takes for granted. Only the prospect of putting a roof over other people's heads seems to comfort Lark, and he goes from town to town, looking for dilapidated houses he can buy, restore and resell at a profit. In Greensboro, North Carolina, Lark finds his biggest challenge yet -- a huge, sturdy, gorgeous shell that's suffered almost a century of abuse at the hands of greedy landlords and transient tenants. As he sinks his teeth into this new project, Lark's new neighborhood starts to work its charms on him. He strikes up a romance with the wry real estate agent who sold him the house. His neighbors, two charming, chatty old ladies, ply him endlessly with delicious Southern cooking. Even Sylvie, the squatter Lark was once desperate to evict from the old house, is now growing on him. But when Lark unearths an old tunnel in the cellar, the house's enchantments start to turn ominous. Sylvie turns cantankerous, even dangerous. There's still a steady supply of food from next door, but it now comes laced with increasingly passionate pleas for Lark to vacate the house at once. In short, everybody seems to want to get rid of him. Whether this is for his own good or theirs, Lark digs in his heels for reasons even he's not sure of. He embarks on a struggle for his life -- and his friends'-- against a house with a past even more tragic than his own. If Lark wins, he gets the kind of home and community he's always dreamed of. If he loses, all is lost....

 id : 247973 ISBN : 0525941479  | name : Zen and the Art of Fatherhood  |  description : "There is nothing to being a dad - and it takes everything you have to stay afloat in the murky yet enlightening stream every father must navigate. If this sounds like a contradiction or a brain-bashing Zen koan, welcome to the club of the fellow confused, and listen to the confessions of a father who's seen it all." "In this humorous and insightful account, Steven Lewis (a happily entrenched father of seven) mingles hilarious personal recollections from nearly thirty years of parenting with quiet reflections and quotes from admired Zen sages to capture the universal paradoxes, dilemmas, and rewards of fatherhood. While to the outside world a father of seven may appear to have the wisdom of a Zen master, to his kids he can seem as much a fool as a wise man. And to his inner self (and often to his wife) he seems like a pure fool, foolishly tripping over himself trying to play the role of a wise man. Yet in the end, he really does have some wisdom to share, and he'll show how you, too, can apply the sublime teachings of Zen to such essential paternal tasks as taming toddlers; balancing sex talks, lies, and video games; sneaking intimate moments alone with your mate; keeping your cool on your daughter's first date; surviving family vacations; and selecting the right college that is distant enough to keep your kids away on weekends." "Zen and the Art of Fatherhood is an essential guide for any man who already is a father or is about to embark on what is the most challenging and gratifying journey of his life."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In 1935, she published her masterpiece, Spring Came on Forever, a novel of two Nebraska pioneer families from settlement to the 1930s.

Her life might be a modest triumph but for one detail: she married the wrong man. Quickly paced and precisely drawn, this novel is Aldrich's greatest tribute to the complexity, humor, endurance, and intelligence of the people who settled the prairie.

McClure's Selected Poems is the first major retrospective collection of a poet and Obie-winning playwright associated with the San Francisco Renaissance from its start as well as the early Beat movement.

 id : 248400 ISBN : 0871402149  | name : Rashomon and Other Stories  |  description : Writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, Ryunosuke Akutagawa created disturbing stories out of Japan's cultural upheaval. Whether his fictions are set centuries past or close to the present, Akutagawa was a modernist, writing in polished, superbly nuanced prose subtly exposing human needs and flaws. "In a Grove," which was the basis for Kurosawa's classic film Rashomon, tells the chilling story of the killing of a samurai through the testimony of witnesses, including the spirit of the murdered man. The fable-like "Yam Gruel" is an account of desire and humiliation, but one in which the reader's sympathy is thoroughly unsettled. And in "The Martyr," a beloved orphan raised by Jesuit priests is exiled when he refuses to admit that he made a local girl pregnant. He regains their love and respect only at the price of his life. All six tales in the collection show Akutagawa as a master storyteller and an exciting voice of modern Japanese literature.

 id : 248498 ISBN : 1562055496  | name : MCSE Study Guide  |  description : Get it done well and get it done fast are twin, apparently opposing, demands. Data architects are increasingly expected to deliver quality data models in challenging timeframes, and agile developers are increasingly expected to ensure that their solutions can be easily integrated with the data assets of the overall organization. If you need to deliver quality solutions despite exacting schedules, The Nimble Elephant will help by describing proven techniques that leverage the libraries of published data model patterns to rapidly assemble extensible and robust designs. The three sections in the book provide guidelines for applying the lessons to your own situation, so that you can apply the techniques and patterns immediately to your current assignments. The first section, Foundations for Data Agility, addresses some perceived aspects of friction between data and agile practitioners. As a starting point for resolving the differences, pattern levels of granularity are classified, and their interdependencies exposed. A context of various types of models is established (e.g. conceptual / logical / physical, and industry / enterprise / project), and you will learn how to customize patterns within specific model types. The second section, Steps Towards Data Agility, shares guidelines on generalizing and specializing, with cautions on the dangers of going too far. Creativity in using patterns beyond their intended purpose is encouraged. The short-term You Aint Gonna Need It (YAGNI) philosophy of agile practitioners, and the longer-term strategic perspectives of architects, are compared and evaluated. Consideration is given to the potential of enterprise views contributing to project-specific models. Other topics include industry models, iterative modeling, creation of patterns when none exist, and patterns for rules-in-data. The section ends with a perspective on the modelers possible role in agile projects, followed by a case study. The final section, A Bridge to the Land of Object Orientation, provides a pathway for re-skilling traditional data modelers who want to expand their options by actively engaging with the ranks of object-oriented developers.

 id : 248620 ISBN : 1562477544  | name : A Song for Jeffrey  |  description : Written by a distinguished group of Third World and American scholars, this book investigates the political, economic, cultural, and religious dynamics of the Third World. Both highly topical and extremely timely, the volume takes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject, employing analytical tools drawn from political science, history, economics, and sociology. The papers included serve to facilitate a new understanding of the complex nature of Third World nationalism, explore critical issues facing the Third World such as widespread hunger in Africa and the mounting debt crisis, and offer new perspectives on the role of religion and ethnicity in Third World politics. In his introduction, Ali sets the context for the papers that follow. He notes that the new nations of the Third World cannot be political and economic equals of the developed nations. Thus, aware of their weaknesses, the overriding concern of Third World leaders is to preserve themselves from foreign encroachment. The 14 subsequent papers define, explain, and analyze the myriad issues and problems that today confront policy-makers in both the Third World and the developed nations, including: the economic impact of OPEC; the political and economic origins of hunger in Africa; the West and Third World Religion; open economics and repressive policies in the Third World; the influences on and effects of U.S. policies towards the Third World. Students of political science as well as policy-makers and diplomats will find Third World At the Crossroads enlightening and provocative reading.

 id : 248622 ISBN : 0375507299  | name : The Snow Geese  |  description : Every spring, millions of geese embark on an arduous three-thousand-mile migration from their winter quarters in the southern United States to their breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic. One year William Fiennes decided to go with them. Intrigued by what hed read about the birds amazing annual journey, Fiennes was also desperate to emerge from a period of illness and from the belief that, at age twenty-six, his life had ground to a halt. The story of his voyage turns out to be about a great deal more than geese. A blend of memoir, natural history, and travel writing,The Snow Geeseis also about homecoming: the birds on their long homeward journey north, the romance of homecomings, the urge to leave home and the even stronger need to return. The arc of Fienness extraordinary adventure is the backbone of a narrative rich in meditations on philosophy and natural science, and deeply perceptive in its descriptions of both physical and emotional travel. Already being compared with Bruce Chatwin and Barry Lopez, William Fiennes is a gifted writer with a voice that is thoughtful, wry, and keenly observant. His book thrums with ideas, with stories and anecdotes, with humankind as well as with birds. The joy of being alive, of being on the move, andabove allof returning home are poignantly captured in this intelligent, exuberant book, a debut of great delicacy and distinction.
 id : 248623 ISBN : 2020258803  | name : La flamme de l'attention  |  description : Krishnamurti (1896-1986) parcourt la planète durant soixante ans en donnant des causeries à de vastes auditoires. Le volume contient des conférences choisies parmi celles qu'il prononça d'octobre 1981 à septembre 1982. L'amour et l'intelligence n'ont pas de cause, ils sont lumière. Les idées sont le fruit du savoir emmagasiné dans le cerveau. Elles découlent d'un processus matériel et sont toujours limitées et soumises à la loi des causes et des effets, elles n'ont aucune prise holistique sur le réel. Lorsque la véritable nature de l'activité mentale dans le psychisme est clairement observée et comprise, le processus de la pensée cesse d'être prédominant. Une telle compréhension est pure intelligence, libre de toute causalité, c'est la voie d'un changement radical de la condition humaine.

 id : 248640 ISBN : 0525940774  | name : The Silver Cloud Café  |  description : "The Silver Cloud Cafe is a novel that goes beyond and beneath. Beyond and beneath the glossy surface of San Francisco. Beyond and beneath the clean-scrubbed image of American life. It goes to the Mission District, where two neon angels stand watch over the ramshackle cantina known as Raphael's Silver Cloud Cafe and where the lost and lonely, desperate and dispossessed, come for a meager portion of solace and salvation in the form of companionship, drink, and sex. It goes to the dark waters under the Fourth Street Bridge, where the corpse of a failed priest surfaces, and to the jailhouse, where a nattily dressed midget takes credit and demands punishment for the crime." "This amazing novel is at once a gripping murder mystery that probes two macabre killings forty years apart and a panoramic meditation on the magical, mystical mix of race and culture in America. Its spellbinding story of intertwining guilt and innocence, crime and punishment, ranges over the century, from the bloody Christero Wars of the Mexican Revolution to the stifling rigidities of class and caste in the Philippines to the bitter harvests of migrants in the California farmlands to the feeding frenzy and human downsizing of the 1990s. Its characters include a Chicano lawyer and a Jewish investigator who have seen too much and believe too little; a Mexican priest torn by twin lusts for sex and vengeance; a black ex-boxer who is down but not out; a bar owner with a sense of divine mission; and a host of other unforgettable men and women who join in a superbly orchestrated symphony of voices and visions."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In fact, for a long period in Japan's history the teeaching of Japanese to foreigners was a serious crime against the state. In this enlightening work, renowned Japanologist Boye Lafayette De Mente discusses how the psychology of the social and political system that evolved over the centuries became imbued in and expressed by the language to a degree seldom seen in other cultures. The author brings more than 25 years of experience in Japan to the task of revealing the hidden cultural significance of current expressions in the Japanese language. With ample reference to history, psychology, philosophy, and religion, the reader learns how the Japanese view certain behaviours and attitudes and why they are conditioned to respond in certain ways to specific situations. Features: 230 quintessentially Japanese expressions that every Japanese knows - and believes that non-Japanese cannot possibly understand a 14-entry set of introductory readings, designed to offer a broad cultural overview of Japan cross-referencing of entires by thematic groupings, such as "Loyalty," "Collective Behaviour," and "Leadership" This innovative text provides readers with the insights necessary for effective communication with their Japanese counterparts. Whatever your involvement with Japan - personal, travel, or business - NTC's Dictionary of Japan's Cultural Code Words is an invaluable and one-of-a-kind reference.

 id : 248695 ISBN : 0140230122  | name : The User Illusion  |  description : As John Casti wrote, "Finally, a book that really does explain consciousness." This groundbreaking work by Denmark's leading science writer draws on psychology, evolutionary biology, information theory, and other disciplines to argue its revolutionary point: that consciousness represents only an infinitesimal fraction of our ability to process information. Although we are unaware of it, our brains sift through and discard billions of pieces of data in order to allow us to understand the world around us. In fact, most of what we call thought is actually the unconscious discarding of information. What our consciousness rejects constitutes the most valuable part of ourselves, the "Me" that the "I" draws on for most of our actions--fluent speech, riding a bicycle, anything involving expertise. No wonder that, in this age of information, so many of us feel empty and dissatisfied. As engaging as it is insightful, this important book encourages us to rely more on what our instincts and our senses tell us so that we can better appreciate the richness of human life.

As sweaty modernity thrusts itself upon us, the veil of ignorance that cloaked our nation hangs in tatters, tattered tatters. Our funny bones are neither fun nor bony.

The light of August turns to the overcast skies of autumn, and the taunting sting of winter cannot be far ahead on the highway of the road on the horizon. Who can sing a song without words? Maybe Bobby McFerrin, but is there anyone else? Where do we go when the party is over? Perhaps the afterparty. But what comes after the afterparty? Questions, there are so many questions, and then some queries, arriving via fax. To these we respond in the only way possible: Talk to the hand, because the face aint listening. Nevertheless, we present the pages within as an offering of peace, as a message of hope, and as a perfumed hankie of lovea hankie drizzled with the intoxicating aroma that has only one name: ha-ha-oopsie.

The revealing autobiography of an American man. Chuck Zito comes by his reputation honestly as one of the toughest, most uncompromising men ever to sit astride a Harley. Now, with tales both hilarious and chilling, violent and truthful, Zito tells his life story in his own words. From growing up on the mean streets of Brooklyn and the Bronx, where fighting was a way of life, to becoming president of the New York chapter of the Hells Angels, to the wild and crazy life of protecting some of the world's biggest celebrities, Zito might be seen as a latter-day outlaw, the last of a dying breed of men. But throughout his tempestuous days, one thing defined him: his unfailing sense of justice, of what's really right and what's really wrong. That's how Zito found himself facing his biggest challenge: refusing to cooperate with a federal investigation into his brothers, the Hells Angels, and in the process losing the very thing he cherished most-his freedom. Zito's astonishing recovery from this experience, and the unique kind of stardom he forged based on hard work and sheer will, is a testament to his courage, his ambition, and his indomitable heart-a testament now recorded unflinchingly in Street Justice.

 id : 248791 ISBN : 0395957907  | name : The Boy  |  description : Who is the boy? And whose body lies beneath a sheet of blue tarpaulin in the basement of a derelict brewery? The discovery of a chilling diary sends Sean Kennedy, once a foster father to the boy, on a desperate search to unlock the secrets of his tragic past and to learn the truth about the boy's part in the disintegration of Sean's family. The boy's compelling and protean personality (he is Devon to the keepers of the Boys' Home, Alex to the Fatman with whom he lives, Priestly to the young rent-boy who reveres him, and Durwood to Sean's daughter) arches over this disturbing novel and is mirrored in the lives of all the people Sean encounters. From these different perspectives we witness the boy's many incarnations, which reflect, aggravate, and distort the desires of those around him, involving these characters irrevocably in his own mysterious intentions. The boy keeps just beyond Sean's reach, then draws him into a final encounter that is both poignant and brutal. This first novel is a penetrating study of innocence and malice ineluctably bound. With his protean sexuality and personality, the boy insinuates himself into the lives of those he encounters. We witness how he feeds their deepest desires, nourishes their greatest needs, and involves them irrevocably in his own intentions. Winner of the Lambda Literary Foundation's Editors' Choice Award for 1998!

The former vice president had determined that if he could not be master of his nation, he would instead become emperor of the Louisiana Territory. Working with the powerful commander of the U.S. Army, General James Wilkinson, Burr instigated a plot to seize not only Louisiana, but all of Mexico. This nefarious plot even included the hapless Zebulon M. Pike." "Jefferson and the Gun-men is the story of this scheme. Montgomery portrays a time when the wildest plots and the most grandiose dreams thrived as schemers, revolutionaries, black-guards, and braggarts conspired to create a new country. In this race to capture the heart of a new frontier, Montgomery finds a young nation just beginning to imagine itself and understand its destiny."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

 id : 248829 ISBN : 0571197213  | name : Dennis Potter  |  description : Dennis Potter's death in 1994 deprived British television of one of the most controversial figure it has ever known. Potter was a prolific writer of genius, author of Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective, but also the butt of the tabloids, who nicknamed him 'Dirty Den' for his 1989 series Blackeyes. For this official biography of Potter Humphrey Carpenter interviewed everyone who came close to him, and had exclusive access to Potter's archives, including the many unmade television and film scripts. Carpenter portrays a very different Potter from the aggressive public image: a deeply shy and reclusive man, who was psychologically as well as physically scarred by the illness which struck him down at the age of 26. Potter was a man with a vast interest in sex but also a terrible loathing of it, thanks to an appalling experience he suffered in childhood. Potter has been a man much gossipped about, both in his lifetime and after his death. Carpenter's remarkable new biography establishes the extraordinary truth behind the rumours, and gives a vivid portrait of the backstage dramas and fights behind Potter's screen triumphs.

 id : 248870 ISBN : 0801844088  | name : Hollyhocks, Lambs, and Other Passions  |  description : This is the story of an old country house and how it grew young again, and of the family that has grown with it during the last thirty years. Built in 1843 in the Worthington Valley of Maryland, Thornhill Farm was a sorry derelict when Dee Hardie and her husband first saw it. Today it is sometimes featured in Dee's monthly column for House Beautiful. Its presence and character have molded the Hardies, even as they have molded Thornhill into something far more than a house surrounded by land. "Hollyhocks, Lambs and Other Passions" shows how a house can embrace a family's joy and provide shelter in sorrow. It tells of the ups and downs of raising four children and forty sheep, of the importance of celebrating everything from christenings to Christmas, of stenciling pineapples on the dining room floor and keeping a piano in the kitchen, of digging a rose garden and painting hollyhocks on the barn wall, of Tom Hardie's Sunday cooking, and tea parties for small grandchildren. Dee's determination to keep-- and make-- traditions runs throughout the book. Dee Hardie herself is the heart of Thornhill Farm. The absolute passion she brings to everything she does, the grace and care with which she lives her life, her infectious delight in the world around her, have made her accounts of Thornhill memorable. With her commitment to living life deliberately, she slows us down, for a time, in a world that moves at breakneck speed.
 id : 248871 ISBN : 0802130771  | name : A Personal Anthology  |  description : After almost a half a century of scrupulous devotion to his art, Jorge Luis Borges personally compiled this anthology of his work--short stories, essays, poems, and brief mordant "sketches," which, in Borges's hands, take on the dimensions of a genre unique in modern letters. In this anthology, the author has put together those pieces on which he would like his reputation to rest; they are not arranged chronologically, but with an eye to their "sympathies and differences." A Personal Anthology, therefore, is not merely a collection, but a new composition.

 id : 248891 ISBN : 088902913X  | name : Restoring Canadian Homes  |  description : It was not an unusual play, at least for me. I was just blocking the plate, trying to save a run in a scoreless tie. Nothing heroic. Nothing foolish. Just trying, as I had since joining the Jays in 1981, to remind a runner that in any game against Toronto, home plate belonged to Buck Martinez, and no one else. Its a play that gets me hit on more occasions than I have time to count. Ive been run over, knocked down, and even (several times) knocked out; but Ive always escaped unscathed, unhurt, determined more than ever to protect that very private piece of turf I call my own. Thats just the way I feel about home plate. My teammates know this. The players with the other clubs know it. Id even guess that most baseball fans who have ever seen me play know it too. Its not just home plate, its "my "home plate. The only trouble on that fateful night in Seattles Kingdome, was that somebody had apparently forgotten to tell Phil Bradley. From spring training to season end, Martinez writes about the players, the coaches, the key games and the emotion of the team winning its first championship. Bucks story is sprinkled with first hand commentaries: the Bell-Kison incident, both crucial series against the Yankees, the best game the Jays ever played and post season games down to the final out.

To stay on the case is unethical, to withdraw will threaten its success, and Tom Deacon, revealing himself in an entirely new light, makes it clear that such treachery will not be forgiven." "For Hugh the dilemma is intensified by the contrast between their lives: Tom, tormented by flashbacks, jobless, with a broken marriage and two children he hardly sees; Hugh, with what he regards as a blessed existence, a rewarding life as a jobbing solicitor and an intensely happy marriage to Lizzie, with whom he has two adopted children, Lou away on her gap year, and fragile, sensitive Charlie, who seems to have overcome his personal demons." "Then one night Hugh's life changes for ever. His happiness is snatched away, and he, like Tom, must face a lifetime of troubling memories."--BOOK JACKET.

 id : 249009 ISBN : 0671029673  | name : The Grim Reaper  |  description : May 1195, and Sir John de Wolfe is faced with a strange series of serial murders, which begins with the suffocation of a Jewish money-lender and proceeds through that of a London harlot, a dissolute priest and a burgess suspected of abusing young boys. The common factor is that an appropriate Biblical text is left at each murder scene, the mode of which reflects the alleged sin of the victim. This means that a literate and Bible-learned killer is involved - which, in an age where only 1% of the population can read or write - can only be a priest. There are at least twenty-five parish churches in Exeter, so the killer could be any one of more than a hundred clerics. Crowner John sets about to discover the identity of the homicidal priest.

 id : 249052 ISBN : 0393308251  | name : From Resistance To Revolution  |  description : "An intellectual interpretation of the American revolution that raises it to a new height of comprehensiveness and significance. A superbly detailed account of the ideological escalation . . . that brought Americans to revolution." Gordon S. Wood, New York Times Book Review In this classic account of the American revolution, Pauline Maier traces the step-by-step process through which the extra-legal institutions of the colonial resistance movement assumed authority from the British. She follows the American Whigs as they moved by stages from the organized resistance of the Stamp Act crisis of 1765 through the non-importation associations of the late 1760s to the collapse of royal government after 1773, the implication of the king in a conspiracy against American liberties, and the consequent Declaration of Independence. Professor Maier's great achievement is to explain how Americans came to contemplate and establish their independence, guided by principle, reason, and experience.

Las escalofriantes imágenes de su muerte dieron la vuelta al mundo. Trastornado por la incomprensible ejecución del reportero de The Wall Street Journal , el célebre pensador, novelista y ensayista Bernard-Henri Lévy , que apoyó la causa musulmana en el conflicto de los Balcanes, decidió profundizar en el caso. El resultado de sus pesquisas y reflexiones es ¿Quién mató a Daniel Pearl? , un relato pormenorizado de lo que vio, vivió y descubrió durante su investigación a lo largo del año 2002. Sus pasos le llevaron de Karachi a Londres, de Sarajevo a Dubai, de Kandahar a Los Ángeles y... de nuevo a Karachi. Indagó en la vida de la víctima y la de sus verdugos; se entrevistó con los testigos; se internó en el mundo del islamismo radical y del grupo liderado por el Omar Sheij el cerebro del crimen; entró en contacto con el nuevo terrorismo y el universo de Bin Laden , quien también desempeñó un papel en la tragedia. En cada etapa de su búsqueda, a Lévy le asaltaban dos preguntas: ¿quién mató realmente a Daniel Pearl? Y ¿qué investigaba éste a su vez?, ¿qué secreto se disponía a revelar cuando lo degollaron?

Meanwhile, Bimbo's parents turn up on Hack's doorstep demanding he turn over their missing daughter, or face a gypsy curse. To add to the mayhem, a local industrialist is badgering Hackshaw to oversee a major renovation to his monstrosity of a house, and Hack's sister Ruth is hectoring him to forget everything else and see to his duties as editor of The Triton Advertiser. Trapped by circumstance, Hack begins poking into things and soon discovers a circus assortment of off-beat characters: gypsies in cowboy hats, a con man with a conscience, a sheriff's investigator without a heartor a brainham-fisted townies, and much, much more.

Nicolas découvre bientôt que ces meurtres paraissent liés à un complot jésuite. Mais ne s'agit-il pas là de fausses apparences, d'une manipulation compliquée des divers partis qui s'affrontent secrètement à la Cour ? " Les aventures de ce nouveau limier se distinguent par leurs qualités littéraires et la singularité du personnage et de son siècle. " Télé Journal

 id : 249185 ISBN : 0862785170  | name : Gift of the Gab  |  description : With illustrations by Terry Willers For the unprepared visitor Irish conversation can be a minefield. 'How's the craic ?' is not an assumption that you are well versed in the properties of narcotics substances, merely an enquiry after your health and general well-being. A seemingly easy question like 'Your'e not from around here are ye?' requires a far more detailed reply than 'No, I'm not'. In order not to be thought rude you should supply details of where you live, why you are in Ireland, the tiny village, now deserted, from which your great-great grandfather emigrated in the year dot, and, to be really accepted, your salary figure, marital status and daily eating habits! To the uninitiated, advice like this might seem extreme, but, as Tadhg Hayes points out, the proper answer will save you from insistent and repeated questioning, which, in the case of the Irish, is motivated by genuine interest and not just downright nosiness. Having safely negotiated the opening gambits, plenty of other conversational pitfalls await the visitor. GIFT OF THE GAB covers them all and will see you through any topic, from THE WEATHER, SPORT, DRINK, DEATH, how to interpret travel directions and statements on a person's financial situation (see THE POOR MOUTH). For Improvers there are useful phrases to add colour to your conversation, including the essential 'feck', 'fecking' and its variations. All in all, the most essential thing, after your umbrella, you will need for an enjoyable holiday in Ireland.

Because in the dark corners of this domestic scene, there are rustlings that none of the players want to hear.

 id : 249233 ISBN : 2221093070  | name : Toute vérité est bonne à dire  |  description : J'aurais pu être un bon gros ministre sympathique dont on aurait dit : " C'est un bon ministre de l'Education : il ne fait rien. " Quatre mois après avoir quitté son poste de la rue de Grenelle, avec la franchise et le talent de conteur qui le caractérisent, Claude Allègre parle. Il dit aujourd'hui tout ce qu'il ne pouvait pas dire quand il était ministre : ce qu'est la réalité inquiétante de l'éducation en France, comment la lourdeur du " mammouth " - qu'il conviendrait mieux de nommer dinosaure - paralyse toutes les initiatives et pénalise les élèves, comment, en dépit de la conscience professionnelle de la grande majorité des profs, une tradition corporatiste et un syndicalisme conservateur bloquent le changement et font que le meilleur système d'enseignement du monde se dégrade chaque année davantage. Ministre réformateur, Claude Allègre tire le bilan de son action de modernisation, dénonce les tares du système et indique les voies de l'avenir pour le système éducatif. Ministre politique, longtemps le plus proche conseiller de Lionel Jospin, il dévoile aussi les coulisses de la vie politique, décrit l'envers du décor de la gauche plurielle et nous fait pénétrer au cur de l'action gouvernementale, comme jamais ne l'avait fait un des principaux personnages de l'Etat. Rouage essentiel de la machine Jospin, il livre enfin le secret d'une ascension fulgurante qui a conduit son ami à Matignon deux ans après qu'on a annoncé sa mort politique. Opération vérité sans précédent, le témoignage de Claude Allègre jette une lumière saisissante sur le véritable fonctionnement de la démocratie française.
 id : 249235 ISBN : 2246535514  | name : Qu'est-ce qu'une vie réussie?  |  description : Les sociétés contemporaines nous incitent à penser la " réussite " sur le mode du rêve éveillé. Rêves de possession " On dirait qu'on aurait gagné à la loterie "... Rêves de séduction : nous voici - enfin - dotés de qualités sublimes, virtuoses d'un instrument de musique dont nous n'avions jusqu'alors tiré que des sons angoissants, champions d'un sport qui commençait à nous décourager, témoignant à l'égard des autres de vertus insoupçonnées... Pouvons-nous en rester là ? Pour répondre à la question de la " vie bonne ", les sagesses anciennes invitaient les humains à régler leur vie sur des principes transcendants. Elles voyaient, par exemple, dans l'harmonie de la nature ou la splendeur du divin, des modèles à imiter. Longtemps encore après la " mort de Dieu ", l'humanité a éprouvé le besoin de sacraliser des idéaux - la patrie, la Révolution - pour donner un sens à l'existence. Ces horizons s'estompent. Ce livre raconte l'histoire des grandes réponses passées, la trame des vies idéales imaginées par nos ancêtres. Il fait ressortir ce qu'elles avaient de plus beau, de plus puissant, ce par quoi elles nous parlent encore. Mais, au-delà de ce récit, il propose une réflexion nouvelle sur la façon dont cette antique interrogation se pose aujourd'hui. Il se pourrait bien, en effet, que notre monde laïc soit moins hostile aux transcendances qu'on ne le dit ; que nous inaugurions, sans toujours y prêter attention, l'époque du réenchantement du monde.
 id : 249236 ISBN : 2253037419  | name : Le roman de la momie  |  description : Dans un tombeau de la Vallée des Rois, un jeune lord anglais et un archéologue découvrent la momie d'une jeune fille à la bouleversante beauté. Près d'elle, un papyrus raconte son histoire... Ainsi nous est révélé le destin de Tahoser, fille d'un grand prêtre d'Egypte, qui s'éprend d'un Hébreu. Elle est prête à partager la vie du peuple esclave, mais Pharaon, passionnément amoureux d'elle, la fait enlever et lui offre puissance et richesse... Le drame culmine lorsque, sur les pas de Moïse, les Hébreux se mettent en marche vers la mer Rouge, bientôt poursuivis par le monarque à la tête de son armée. Pour reconstituer la splendeur de la civilisation du Nil à son apogée et ressusciter ses villes défuntes, Théophile Gautier a utilisé toutes les connaissances de l'égyptologie naissante. Il nous donne ainsi un des premiers romans de l'Egypte ancienne, telle que l'Europe avait pu la rêver depuis l'expédition de Bonaparte et les travaux de Champollion.

 id : 249243 ISBN : 0801853958  | name : Greek Mythology  |  description : Allegorists in ancient Greece attempted to find philosophical and physical truths in myth. Plato, who resolutely excluded myths from the sphere of truth, thought that they could express ideas in a realm he could not reach with dialectical reasoning. Freud built a science around the myth of Oedipus, saying that myths were "distorted wish dreams of entire nations, the dreams of early mankind." No body of myth has served more purposes - or been subject to more analysis - than Greek mythology. This is a revised translation of Fritz Graf's highly acclaimed introduction to Greek mythology, Griechische Mythologie: Eine Einfuhrung, originally published in 1985 by Artemis Verlag. Graf offers a chronological account of the principal Greek myths that appear in the surviving literary and artistic sources, and concurrently documents the history of interpretation of Greek mythology from the seventeenth century to the present. First surveying the various definitions of myth that have been advanced, Graf proceeds to look at the relationship between Greek myths and epic poetry; the absence of an "origin of man" myth in Creek mythology; and connection between particular myths and shrines or holy festivals; the harmony in Greek literature between myth and history; the use of myth in Greek song and tragedy; and the uses and interpretations of myth by philosophers and allegorists.

 id : 249258 ISBN : 2253098302  | name : Poèmes saturniens  |  description : Des Poèmes saturniens, entendons qu'ils sont placés sous le signe de Saturne. Ils seront donc inspirés : il n'était pas inutile de l'affirmer alors que régnaient encore des versificateurs parnassiens. Ils seront aussi baignés d'une rêverie douce et savante, tandis que le poète tournera son regard vers l'intérieur. Point ou peu de récits ou d'anecdotes. Ici l'on se souvient, l'espace d'un sonnet - et non d'un interminable poème-, sur un air de chanson grise. Et il n'est pas jusqu'à celle que l'on aime qui ne prenne une forme incertaine. Tout semble simple. Tout est savant, mais d'une technique si maîtrisée qu'elle a cessé d'être visible, au point que beaucoup s'y sont trompés. Verlaine est un poète à la fois immédiat et difficile. Il exige donc une annotation riche et précise (combien de parodies qui avaient échappé jusqu'à cette édition à l'attention des lecteurs ?), une attention à la langue et à la prosodie, alors, mais alors seulement, comme l'avait dit à peu près Ovide : " Maintenant, va mon livre, où le hasard te mène !

" Primo Levi (1919 - 1987) n'examine pas son expérience des camps nazis comme un accident de l'Histoire, mais comme un événement exemplaire qui permet de comprendre jusqu'où peut aller l'homme dans le rôle du bourreau ou dans celui de la victime. Quelles sont les structures d'un système autoritaire et quelles sont les techniques pour anéantir la personnalité d'un individu ? Quel rapport sera créé entre les oppresseurs et les opprimés ? Comment se crée et se construit un monstre ? Est-il possible de comprendre de l'intérieur la logique de la machine de l'extermination ? Est-il possible de se révolter contre elle ? Primo Levi ne se borne pas à décrire les aspects des camps qui restaient obscurs jusqu'à aujourd'hui, mais dresse un bilan pour lutter contre l'accoutumance à la dégradation de l'humain.

 id : 249334 ISBN : 0767900022  | name : The Illuminated Rumi  |  description : Rise up nimbly and go on your strange journey to the ocean of meanings... In the mid-thirteenth century, in a dusty marketplace in Konya, Turkey, a city where Muslim, Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist travelers mingled, Jelaluddin Rumi, a popular philosopher and scholar, met Shams of Tabriz, a wandering dervish. Their meeting forever altered the course of Rumi's life and influenced the mystical evolution of the planet. The bond they formed was everlasting--a powerful transcendent friendship that would flow through Rumi as some of the world's best-loved ecstatic poetry. Rumi's passionate, playful poems find and celebrate sacred life in everyday existence. They speak across all traditions, to all peoples, and today his relevance and popularity continue to grow. In The Illuminated Rumi, Coleman Barks, widely regarded as the world's premier translator of Rumi's writings, presents some of his most brilliant work, including many new translations. To complement Rumi's universal vision, Michael Green has worked the ancient art of illumination into a new, visually stunning form that joins typography, original art, old masters, photographs, and prints with sacred images from around the world. The Illuminated Rumi is a truly groundbreaking collaboration that interweaves word and image: a magnificent meeting of ancient tradition and modern interpretation that uniquely captures the spiritual wealth of Rumi's teachings. Coleman Barks's wise and witty commentary, together with Michael Green's art, makes this a classic guide to the life of the soul for a whole new generation of seekers.

 id : 249341 ISBN : 0688177719  | name : Poachers  |  description : In ten stunning and bleak tales set in the woodlands, swamps and chemical plants along the Alabama River, Tom Franklin stakes his claim as a fresh, original Southern voice. His lyric, deceptively simple prose conjures a world where the default setting is violence, a world of hunting and fishing, gambling and losing, drinking and poaching-a world most of us have never seen. In the chilling title novella (selected for the anthologies New Stories from the South: The Year's Best, 1999 and Best Mystery Stories of the Century), three wild boys confront a mythic game warden as mysterious and deadly as the river they haunt. And, as a weathered, hand-painted sign reads: "Jesus is not coming." This terrain isn't pretty, isn't for the weak of heart, but in these deperate, lost people, Franklin somehow finds the moments of grace that make them what they so abundantly are: human.

The range is impressive from the instantly recognizable to the virtually unknown in all fields of social reform, politics, literature, and entertainment. One is compelled to ask why some of these women remain obscure, and so the volume stands as an interesting platform for discussion. Annotation copyright by Book News, Inc., Portland, OR

 id : 249369 ISBN : 1565846621  | name : The Fifth Act  |  description : The scripts of award-winning film director Ingmar Bergman have been among the most important documents in film history. Though his vision in such films as Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal has shaped our thinking about the cinema, none of his most recent films have been shown in U.S. theaters. This book brings to English readers for the first time some of the finest creations of Bergman's mature years. In these three scenarios of extraordinary frankness, even rawness, Bergman shows his tender yet realistic views on the world of theater, cinema, and acting, culminating with In the Presence of a Clown, where he returns to the character of his Uncle Carl, an irrepressible inventor who comes up with an early version of the talking film. These most recent scripts, in effect Bergman's own fifth act, add an important and moving chapter to his life work. A preface contextualizing the scripts within Bergman's oeuvre has been added by Lasse Bergstrom, a noted Swedish film critic as well as the publisher of Bergman's work in Sweden.
 id : 249370 ISBN : 2253146501  | name : Le sang des rois  |  description : Sur l'île de Chypre, à l'appel du roi Saint Louis, les chevaliers se rassemblent en vue de la septième croisade. C'est alors que surgissent, capturés par les Templiers sur une galère pirate, Roç et Yeza, le frère et la soeur, rescapés du massacre des Cathares à Montségur. Dans leurs veines coulerait, dit-on, le sang de Jésus-Christ... Ainsi commence une course-poursuite à travers tout le Moyen-Orient. Emissaires de la papauté et du Saint Empire, serviteurs de Charles d'Anjou, le frère du roi de France, aussi bien que Sarrasins et séides du " Vieux de la Montagne ", veulent s'emparer des deux adolescents, susceptibles, si leur sang se mêlait à celui des fils de Mahomet, de réconcilier les deux grands monothéismes. Dans le prolongement direct des Enfants du Graal, Peter Berling nous conte une fabuleuse aventure où l'imagination la plus puissante enrichit sans la déformer une histoire dont il connaît tous les enjeux : celle de l'Occident et de son choc multiséculaire avec le monde arabe et l'Islam.

De lo que no hay duda es de que el autor -fiel a su peculiar estilo- llegó a arriesgar su propia integridad física, provocando su detención por la policía de Roma..., por exigencias del guión.

 id : 249391 ISBN : 0805069194  | name : Among the Bears  |  description : A first-person account of wild bear behavior that is both a thrilling animal story and a groundbreaking work of science. In the spring of 1993, Ben Kilham, a naturalist who lives in the woodlands of New Hampshire, began raising a pair of orphaned wild black bears. The experience changed his life. While spending thousands of hours with the cubs, Kilham discovered unknown facets of bear behavior that have radically revised our understanding of animal behavior. Now widely recognized for his contributions to wildlife science, Kilham reveals that bears are altruistic and cooperate with unrelated, even unknown individuals, while our closer relatives, the supposedly more highly evolved chimps, cooperate only within troops of recognizable members. Kilham, who turned a disability, dyslexia, to his advantage as a naturalist, offers fascinating insights into the emotional life of bears. His work-which has been featured in several National Geographic television specials-also illustrates the powerful black bear intelligence that has survived bounties and overhunting to make them North America's dominant omnivore, familiar to every reader. Beyond the natural history, he introduces individual bears who become enthralling and memorable characters. As in the bestselling books by Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, Among the Bears explores the breaking down of mutual suspicion and building up of trust between species, with its hopeful implications for the shared future of humans and animals in the wild.

Yet again, readers will find that William Safire's apparently endless capacity to be fascinated by language is highly contagious. " --Kirkus Reviews America's most entertaining language maven is back with more words to live by in his latest exploration of hot catchphrases, syntactical controversies, and other matters of national linguistic importance. Before you scratch that seven-year-itch, you might want to know where it came from. And before someone blurts, "You just don't get it," perhaps you should consult the Pulitzer Prize winning language columnist on the origins of that snappy feminist motto. In Watching My Language, William Safire investigates these questions and many others, including: What language was Bill Clinton speaking when he fumed, "I want to put a fist halfway down their throats with this. . . . I want their teeth on the sidewalk ?" Why is Ukraine no longer the Ukraine? Should there be an insurrection against this usage? Did baseball manager Leo Durocher really say, "Nice guys finish last" ? Who deserves credit for coining the expressions policy wonk, digerati, and Not!? William Safire, a man hip enough to explore the meaning of hip-hop, answers these questions and many more in this witty and enlightening collection. Praise for William Safire "Safire infuses his verbiage with humor, timely examples, and quotes, resulting in mini-essays that are informative and intriguing." --Nashville Banner "Wonderful. . . . Where once stood your seventh-grade English teacher guarding the narrow gates of good usage andcorrect grammar now stands William Safire. . . . His true calling is chasing down first-time uses of a trendy phrase, spotting literary allusions, and most of all, keeping the American language on the straight and narrow. . . . Your old English teacher would approve." --The Dallas Morning News

La tercera parte abarca hasta hoy mismo, y se centra en su compromiso político. El autor se explaya en sus gustos, sus aficiones y sus preferencias. Las lecturas de infancia, las carreras de caballos, los filósofos que siempre le acompañan o los lugares y las personas que ama forman parte de esta historia. En esta obra única, cargada de saber y sentimiento, el autor mira los tramos del camino recorrido, consciente de que uno no lo puede contar todo de sí mismo.

 id : 249626 ISBN : 1841581410  | name : This Accursed Land  |  description : On the same coast, somewhere, were his other men... What had they found? Where were they? His own party was lodged in the chilled breath of this vast polar wilderness where he wrote: 'The winds have a force so tterrific as to eclipse anything previously known in the world. We have found the kingdom of blizzards. We have come to an accursed land.' Sir Douglas Mawson's epic and tragic journey across 600 miles of unknown Antarctic wasteland has been described by Sir Edmund Hillary as 'the greatest story of lone survival in Antarctic exploration'. This Accursed Land tells the story of how Mawson declined to join Scott's ill-fated British expedition in order to lead the Australasian party and his three man team which set out to explore the far eastern coastline of the Antarctic continent. The loss of one of his men and most of his supplies turned a hazardous trek into a nightmare. Mawson and his colleague, Mertz, were trapped 320 miles from base with only nine days' food and nothing for the dogs. They lived on the journey back by slaughtering their starving animals and eating what is now known to have been poisoned meat. Mawson's ultimate and lone struggle for survival after Mertz's des

 id : 249635 ISBN : 0451517857  | name : Julius Caesar  |  description : "The First Folio of 1623 is the definitive edition of Shakespeare's plays. It is more often than not the closest we can now get to what Shakespeare actually wrote. But the Folio's antiquated typography and cramped layout make it remote and inaccessible to modern eyes. The Shakespeare Folios on the other hand offer easy access directly to the First Folio by presenting the text in modern type but otherwise unchanged. All the First Folio's idiosyncrasies of layout and spelling, even its obvious errors, have been scrupulously left intact, but the text suddenly becomes as easily legible as the script of any modern play." "As an additional aid to understanding, readers will find, printed opposite each page of the Folio, the very same passage in a modern edition. So, whenever the Folio presents a problem, the reader can refer to this parallel text for a solution, either in the text itself or in the set of notes at the end of the book. These notes draw on the long tradition of Shakespearean scholarship and include full reference to surviving Quarto texts."--BOOK JACKET.

 id : 249637 ISBN : 0385502893  | name : The Power of Intuition  |  description : At times in our careers, we've all been aware of a "gut feeling" guiding our decisions. Too often, we dismiss these feelings as "hunches" and therefore untrustworthy. But renowned researcher Gary Klein reveals that, in fact, 90 percent of the critical decisions we make is based on our intuition. In his new book, THE POWER OF INTUITION, Klein shows that intuition, far from being an innate "sixth sense," is a learnable--and essential--skill. Based on interviews with senior executives who make important judgments swiftly, as well as firefighters, emergency medical staff, soldiers, and others who often face decisions with immediate life-and-death implications, Klein demonstrates that the expertise to recognize patterns and other cues that enable us--intuitively--to make the right decisions--is a natural extension of experience. Through a three-tiered process called the "Exceleration Program," Klein provides readers with the tools they need to build the intuitive skills that will help them make tough choices, spot potential problems, manage uncertainty, and size up situations quickly. Klein also shows how to communicate such decisions more effectively, coach others in the art of intuition, and recognize and defend against an overdependence on information technology. The first book to demystify the role of intuition in decision making, THE POWER OF INTUITION is essential reading for those who wish to develop their intuition skills, wherever they are in the organizational hierarchy.

 id : 249644 ISBN : 2859404821  | name : Coup de lame  |  description : Le livre Huis-clos au large : un paradoxe qui nen est pas un pour ceux qui connaissent et la mer et les hommes. Mettons tout de suite les choses au point : Coup de lame na rien dun roman « marin ». On a jeté par-dessus bord le vieux lyrisme du type « mer cruelle », pour ne garder que ces six hommes enfermés dans une coque dacier et qui font leur métier de pêcheurs de thon, à lextrême pointe du XXe siècle. Ce qui compte ici, ce sont ces six personnages démarrés, et lépoque qui les a pris dans sa nasse et qui ne les lâche plus. Le capitaine en est peut-être à sa dernière campagne. La routine et le confort en ont fait un terrien malgré lui. Air connu : « Faute de destinée, on saccommode dune carrière. » Tant et si bien que le bonhomme songe plus à la taille de ses pommiers quà la colère des patrons de barque espagnols qui font une ronde menaçante autour de son chalutier ultramoderne. Bah, on narrête pas le progrès, se dit-il, songeant à son avenir de vieil homme rangé  cependant que ses hommes remâchent, chacun pour soi, des rêves qui ont un goût plus ou moins prononcé damertume. À ceci près que le progrès est un allié sournois, que les hommes font semblant davoir la peau dure... et que les coups de lame ne viennent jamais de là où on les attend. Lhistoire qua nouée ici Marc Trillard, en serrant bien fort les nuds de son filet, ne concerne pas seulement, on laura compris, cette poignée dhommes affairés à leur métier, quelque part au large de la côte Basque. Cette histoire est aussi bien la nôtre. Et elle fait mal, très mal. L'auteur Marc Trillard, né en 1955, a conquis un vaste public de lecteurs dès la publication de son roman Eldorado 51 (prix Interallié 1994). Ont suivi Tête de cheval (1995), puis Cabotage (1996)  récit de voyage aux îles du Cap Vert.

 id : 249681 ISBN : 0060008954  | name : Dharma Punx  |  description : Fueled by the music of revolution, anger, fear, and despair, we dyed our hair or shaved our heads ... Eating acid like it was candy and chasing speed with cheap vodka, smoking truckloads of weed, all in a vain attempt to get numb and stay numb. This is the story of a young man and a generation of angry youths who rebelled against their parents and the unfulfilled promise of the sixties. As with many self-destructive kids, Noah Levine's search for meaning led him first to punk rock, drugs, drinking, and dissatisfaction. But the search didn't end there. Having clearly seen the uselessness of drugs and violence, Noah looked for positive ways to channel his rebellion against what he saw as the lies of society. Fueled by his anger at so much injustice and suffering, Levine now uses that energy and the practice of Buddhism to awaken his natural wisdom and compassion. While Levine comes to embrace the same spiritual tradition as his father, bestselling author Stephen Levine, he finds his most authentic expression in connecting the seemingly opposed worlds of punk and Buddhism. As Noah Levine delved deeper into Buddhism, he chose not to reject the punk scene, instead integrating the two worlds as a catalyst for transformation. Ultimately, this is an inspiring story about maturing, and how a hostile and lost generation is finally finding its footing. This provocative report takes us deep inside the punk scene and moves from anger, rebellion, and self-destruction, to health, service to others, and genuine spiritual growth.

They all indulged in chiasmus-a literary device in which word order is reversed to hilarious or poignant effect. When Mae West said, "It's not the men in my life, it's the life in my men," she was using chiasmus; when John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country," he was doing the same. Dr. Mardy Grothe has compiled hundreds of examples of chiasmus in this whimsically illustrated collection, bringing this witty and thought-provoking device out of obscurity and into the public imagination.

 id : 249745 ISBN : 0156029723  | name : Elsewhere in the Land of Parrots  |  description : Reclusive David Huntington writes rigorously meaningless poetry to great acclaim. But he lives fearfully, sleeping and working with earplugs, rarely going outside, drawing his life more closely around him every day. A wild parrot, a gift from his father, becomes the breach in the dike: Little Wittgenstein has a jungle shriek, fierce eyes, and a beak that wreaks havoc. David finally throws the bird out the window--and follows it into the world. His guilty search for the parrot takes him first to Telegraph Hill, where the parrot may have found others of its kind. Inexorably David is drawn even farther, lured to South America by rumors of an ancient flock in the wild mangrove swamps. There he meets the lovely level-headed Fern, an American scientist who has her own reasons for searching for the birds. Will he retreat, or follow the parrots' call? Jim Paul has created a tender, whimsical romance, told with wit and subtlety, about having the courage to heed the messages the world sends you, and to welcome unexpected love.

 id : 249747 ISBN : 020157053X  | name : The Mother Side of Midnight  |  description : "There comes a moment in every parent's life when it's time to pack away the playpen, pass along the baby clothes, and sell the infant swing. You have graduated from childbearing and now you major in childrearing. You have finished having babies; now you must learn to live with children." "In The Mother Side of Midnight, Teryl Zarnow, mother of three, offers her wry yet reassuring look at surviving the switch from colic to carpools and from booties to Nikes. It is a glorious time, filled with equal parts nostalgia and relief--when your last baby is potty-trained, when the family wheels no longer include a stroller, and when sleeping through the night is finally a routine occurrence and no longer cause for celebration. Then, all of a sudden you find you've changed your tune from lullabies to the lunchbox blues." "Zarnow's family is outrageous but ordinary. Out of 31 possible flavors, her life is vanilla. Her husband and three children are generic--which is precisely why she writes about them: because they are like everyone else. You've seen them everywhere: the 3-year-old hangs from the highest monkey bar and then screams in panic for mommy to rescue him. After she takes him down, he climbs up again. Her five-year-old daughter is trying to decide whom she will marry; the seven-year-old is the one flapping his arms like a chicken at a rate exceeded only by his mouth as he walks into first grade. Her husband is caught between family and career, and never remembers to empty the dishwasher without being told. But marriage is improving--they're no longer forced to choose between sex and sleep." "As a mother, Zarnow can be as disappointed in her children as she is by the sorry state of her thighs. Some days, she sees troubles ahead just as clearly as the crumbs on her kitchen floor. Other days, she feels blessed by the children who are hers to love. From the Tooth Fairy to homework to the Great War Over the Cherries in the Fruit Cocktail--to more serious issues such as religion, death, and the "F" word--Zarnow gives you the comforting feeling that when it comes to the joys, guilts, and frustrations (not necessarily in that order) of parenting in the post-pabulum years, you are not alone."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Le Guin For forty years, Colony 3245.12 has been Ofelias home. On this planet far away in space and time from the world of her youth, she has lived and loved, weathered the death of her husband, raised her one surviving child, lovingly tended her garden, and grown placidly old. And it is here that she fully expects to finish out her daysuntil the shifting corporate fortunes of the Sims Bancorp Company dictates that Colony 3245.12 is to be disbanded, its residents shipped off, deep in cryo-sleep, to somewhere new and strange and not of their choosing. But while her fellow colonists grudgingly anticipate a difficult readjustment on some distant world, Ofelia savors the promise of a golden opportunity. Not starting over in the hurly-burly of a new community . . . but closing out her life in blissful solitude, in the place she has no intention of leaving. A population of one. With everything she needs to sustain her, and her independent spirit to buoy her, Ofelia actually does start life overfor the first time on her own terms: free of the demands, the judgments, and the petty tyrannies of others. But when a reconnaissance ship returns to her idyllic domain, and its crew is mysteriously slaughtered, Ofelia realizes she is not the sole inhabitant of her paradise after all. And, when the inevitable time of first contact finally arrives, she will find her life changed yet againin ways she could never have imagined. . . . Pure satisfaction from cover to cover.Anne McCaffrey

 id : 249769 ISBN : 0375412484  | name : Nakedness, Death, and the Number Zero  |  description : The critically acclaimed poet and translator Brooks Haxton embraces life, from our naked beginnings to the first signs of middle age and beyond, in this inviting collection of poems. The book opens with the dramatic birth of twins, and speaks in the intimate voice of a husband, father, and poet. Diverse products of the imagination pass through Haxtons generous mindthe mysterious number zero, Miltons Lycidas, nuclear technologyeven as he captures the humor and pathos of the everyday. In these brief, exquisite lyrics, meditations, and short stories in verse, he immerses his reader in the heat of teenage rivalry and friendship, the tender comedy of sex, and the amazements of the natural world. Here, from a book indelible in its language and feeling, are the last few lines: My daughters my twin girls say Ba for bird for book for bottleBa: in Egypt, bird with a human head, the soul. They wake and wake their mother. Ba! They point into the dark. Ba, Ba! they say, and back to nursing weary in her arms.

 id : 249772 ISBN : 0375709436  | name : The Beforelife  |  description : In this stunning collection, Franz Wright chronicles the journey back from a place of isolation and wordlessness. After a period when it seemed certain he would never write poetry again, he speaks with bracing clarity about the twilit world that lies between madness and sanity, addiction and recovery. Wright negotiates the precarious transition from illness to health in a state of skeptical rapture, discovering along the way the exhilaration of love--both divine and human--and finding that even the most battered consciousness can be good company. Whether he is writing about his regret for the abortion of a child, describing the mechanics of slander ("I can just hear them on the telephone and keening all their kissy little knives"), or composing an ironic ode to himself ("To a Blossoming Nut Case"), Wright's poems are exquisitely precise. Charles Simic has characterized him as a poetic miniaturist, whose "secret ambition is to write an epic on the inside of a matchbook cover." Time and again, Wright turns on a dime in a few brief lines, exposing the dark comedy and poignancy of his heightened perception. Here is one of the poems from the collection: Description of Her Eyes Two teaspoonfuls, and my mind goes everyone can kiss my ass now-- then it's changed, I change my mind. Eyes so sad, and infinitely kind.
 id : 249773 ISBN : 0375709479  | name : Some Assembly Required  |  description : George Bradley, whose previous work has drawn praise from James Merrill and Harold Bloom, here meditates on contemporary culture, on the natural world and the world imagined, and on the life of the poet. Whether he is standing in line at the SuperSave, where tabloids beckon, or contemplating the change of seasons in a classic sonnet sequence, Bradley juxtaposes the sublime workings of the mind with the mundane static that surrounds it. What he finds in this conjunction is a surprising beauty, a uniquely contemporary formal music, and, often, a curative dose of humor. Even verse itself is not exempt from his clarifying view, as he proves in "How I Got in the Business," a wild ride through several sorts of commerce, including the poetry trade. Throughout "Some Assembly Required, Bradley savors both the riveting accident of everyday life and the long view afforded by art, in poetry that is taut, witty, and dynamic. "From the Hardcover edition.
 id : 249774 ISBN : 0375725342  | name : The Art of Travel  |  description : A wise and utterly original book of travel essays from an international bestselling author that will give one an expansive sense of wonder (The Baltimore Sun). Any Baedeker will tell us where we ought to travel, but only Alain de Botton will tell us how and why. With the same intelligence and insouciant charm he brought to How Proust Can Save Your Life, de Botton considers the pleasures of anticipation; the allure of the exotic, and the value of noticing everything from a seascape in Barbados to the takeoffs at Heathrow. Even as de Botton takes the reader along on his own peregrinations, he also cites such distinguished fellow-travelers as Baudelaire, Wordsworth, Van Gogh, the biologist Alexander von Humboldt, and the 18th-century eccentric Xavier de Maistre, who catalogued the wonders of his bedroom. The Art of Travel is a refreshing and profoundly readable" book (The Philadelphia Inquirer). Dont leave home without it.

 id : 249783 ISBN : 0385335261  | name : Plant Life  |  description : Her luminous first novel, Moon Women, won the hearts of both readers and critics, who called it richly textured...a pleasure to be savored by a writer to watch. (Kirkus Reviews) Now Pamela Duncan returns to the rich landscape of the human heart with a lush, resonant novel about mothers and daughters, about family and friendship, about a woman at a turning point in her life and the extraordinary world she discovers in a place called home Its Christmastime in Russell, North Carolina. For Laurel Granger, the holiday cant pass quickly enough. With her fifteen-year marriage ending, the visit to her hometown is bound to be even more painful than usual. And the worst part will be looking at the lives of her mother, Pansy, and Pansys gossipy group of friends, for whom life revolves around the plant, the aging textile mill where for decades they have found companionship, a modest livelihood, and a purpose. But with her own marriage disintegratingthe full scope of the disaster hasnt become clear to her yetLaurel has nowhere else to turn except Russell, and to the women of the plant. And soon what Laurel begins to see is not the stifling town she couldnt wait to leave, nor women whose lives seem petty and plain, but a place where powerful secrets have been kept...where hearts and lives have been broken...and where a group of extraordinary women may have a thing or two to teach her about life. Most of all, as Laurel starts to live and even love a little again, she is faced with her mother, and her mother before her, and what their complex relationship has meant for Laurel all these years. Weaving together the voices of several remarkable women across generations, Pamela Duncan tells a story of faith and forgiveness, acts of love and acts of betrayal. With the same artful brushstrokes that made Moon Women a wonder, Duncan paints a masterful portrait of seemingly ordinary lives, and of what it means to grow a life and a futurein the rich soil of the past.

 id : 249848 ISBN : 0679750703  | name : Havana Dreams  |  description : A fascinating, powerfully evocative story of four generations of Cuban women, through whose lives the author illuminates a vivid picture--both personal and historical--of Cuba in our century. "When I want to read a culture," writes Wendy Gimbel in her prologue, "I listen to stories about families, sensing in their contours the substance of larger mysteries." And certainly in the Revuelta family she has found a source of both mystery and revelation. At its center is Naty: born in 1925, educated in the United States, a socialite during the Batista era, who after marriage to a prominent doctor and the birth of a daughter became intoxicated with Castro and his revolution (here, published for the first time, are the letters they exchanged while he was in jail). Though her husband and daughter immigrated to the United States after Castro's victory, Naty remained in Cuba to raise her second child, Castro's unacknowledged daughter, only to be ultimately confronted by his dismissive, withering judgment: "Naty missed the train." Her two daughters, one of whom settles well into life in America, while the other never recovers from her father's intransigent repudiation of her; her granddaughter, who Naty desperately believes will return to Cuba when--not if--Castro is removed from the island; and her mother, an unregenerate reactionary: these are the lives that complete this extraordinary story. Each of the women is irrevocably marked with a part of the island's terrible and poignant tale, and Wendy Gimbel has created a rich and intense narrative of their lives and times. Havana Dreams leaves us with an indelible impression of familial obligation and illicit love; of the heady but doomed romanticism of revolution; and of the profound consequences of Cuba's contemporary history for the ordinary and most intimate lives of its people.
 id : 249849 ISBN : 0679760369  | name : The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith  |  description : From a writer whom Thomas Keneally calls "one of the great figures on the cusp of the millennium" comes a novel that conjures an entire world that suggests our own, but tilted on its axisa world whose most powerful country, Voorstand, dominates its neighbors with ruthless espionage and its mesmerizing but soul-destroying Sirkus. Into that world comes Tristan Smith, a malformed, heroically willful, and unforgivingly observant child. Tristan's life includes adventure and loss, political intrigue, and a bizarre stardom in the Voorstand Sirkus, where animals talk and human performers die real deaths. The result is a visionary picaresque, staggering in its inventions, spellbinding in its suspense, and unabashedly moving.

 id : 249873 ISBN : 0743255518  | name : Going with the Grain  |  description : "My lifelong love affair with bread has less to do with crust, crumb, and the vagaries of sourdough cultures and more to do with bread as a reflection of people's varied beliefs, daily lives, and blood memories....Bread tells the most essential human stories." So begins Susan Seligson's personal and often humorous journey to discover the secrets of the baker's trade and the place bread has in the lives of those who consume it. Part travelogue, part cultural history, with a handful of recipes thrown in for good measure, it is an exploration of the customs, traditions, and rituals around the creating and eating of this most basic and enduring form of sustenance. Bread is the stuff of life. Governments have been overthrown and religious rituals created because of it. Fry bread, matzo, ksra, nan, baguette: all are as resonant of their specific culture as any artifact. In Going with the Grain, Seligson wanders the streets of the Casbah in Fès, Morocco, to unlock the secrets of the thousand-year-old communal bakeries there. In Saratoga Springs, New York, she finds a bread maker so committed to making the ultimate loaf, he built a unique sixty-ton hearth and uses only certified biodynamically grown wheat. Seligson knelt in the Jordanian desert beside a woman turning flat breads over glowing embers and plumbed the mysteries of Wonder Bread in an aseptic American factory. As satisfying as a slice of good bread with butter, Going with the Grain is for the armchair traveler and armchair baker alike.

But his money doesnt provide a happy marriage, or good relationships with his twin daughtersand it does nothing to protect his family when someone brutally murders his wife and daughter in their own home. When Detective Constable Maeve Kerrigan arrives at the scene, the two survivorsPhilip and his second favorite daughter, Lydiaboth claim to have seen nothing, but its clear right away that this is an unhappy family accustomed to keeping secrets. Maeve soon finds herself entangled in a case with a thousand leads that all seem to point nowhere, and it doesnt help that her boss, whom she trusts more than almost anyone, is starting to make decisions that Maeve finds questionable at best. In The Last Girl, Jane Casey once again demonstrates her ability to write vivid, three-dimensional characters and spin a gripping, unpredictable mystery.

Donald Hall tells about life on a small farm where, as a boy, he spent summers with his grandparents. Gradually the boy grows to be a young man, sees his grandparents aging, the farm become marginal, and finally, the cows sold and the barn abandoned. But these are more than nostalgic memories, for in the measured and tender prose of each episode are signs of the end of things - a childhood, perhaps a culture. In an Epilogue written for this edition, Donald Hall describes his return to the farm twenty-five years later, to live the rest of his life in the house of string. We take pleasure in bringing back into print this classic account of boyhood summers in old New England, with the addition of an Epilogue and an album of family snapshots.

Twelve, he logged those woods for years with his father--Arkansas, the great depression, doing whatever they could. Groaning, he jerked and jerked the axe like a pump handle, he screamed and went on pumping until the foot fell back, hinged by the ankle, white and spurting. With a bandana he held it and held it while Arkansas flooded, and saw his father running, his own axe raised ready to kill whatever snake slashed the heel of his son. I learned that scar like a tree split by lightning, healed over, knew my father had in him a boy who had suffered alone in a forest.

 id : 249935 ISBN : 1400030838  | name : There Are No Shortcuts  |  description : Year after year, Rafe Esquiths fifth-grade students excel. They read passionately, far above their grade level; tackle algebra; and stage Shakespeare so professionally that they often wow the great Shakespearen actor himself, Sir Ian McKellen. Yet Esquith teaches at an L.A. innercity school known as the Jungle, where few of his students speak English at home, and many are from poor or troubled families. Whats his winning recipe? A diet of intensive learning mixed with a lot of kindness and fun. His kids attend class from 6:30 A.M. until well after 4:00 P.M., right through most of their vacations. They take field trips to Europe and Yosemite. They play rock and roll. Mediocrity has no place in their classroom. And the results follow them for life, as they go on to colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. Possessed by a fierce idealism, Esquith works even harder than his students. As an outspoken maverick of public education (his heroes include Huck Finn and Atticus Finch), he admits to significant mistakes and heated fights with administrators and colleagues. We allteachers, parents, citizenshave much to learn from his candor and uncompromising vision.
 id : 249936 ISBN : 1400041422  | name : False Prophet  |  description : Stan Rice, who died in December 2002, was a poet of unique, uncompromising vision. Joy and brutality, faith and faithlessness, the beauty of truth and, at times, of untruththese opposing forces come together one last time in his final book of poetry, a haunting collection of psalms. Beginning with his Psalm 151that is, taking up where the Bible leaves offRice calls us to his own kind of prayer and contemplation. Lord, hear me out, he begins. At the point of our need / The storehouse shares its shambles. An elegant, passionate, tragic lament for our condition, Rices homemade psalms exhort us indirectly to accept our fatethe world as it is. In the brave, unshrinking manner that has characterized his whole career, Rice has written a profound farewell.
 id : 249937 ISBN : 1400051266  | name : Pigs at the Trough  |  description : Who filled the trough? Who set the table at the banquet of greed? How has it been possible for corporate pigs to gorge themselves on grossly inflated pay packages and heaping helpings of stock options while the average American struggles to make do with their leftovers? Provocative political commentator Arianna Huffington yanks back the curtain on the unholy alliance of CEOs, politicians, lobbyists, and Wall Street bankers who have shown a brutal disregard for those in the office cubicles and on the factory floors. As she puts it: The economic game is not supposed to be rigged like some shady ring toss on a carnival midway. Yet it has been, allowing corporate crooks to bilk the public out of trillions of dollars, magically making our pensions and 401(k)s disappear and walking away with astronomical payouts and absurdly lavish perks-for-life. The media have put their fingers on pieces of the sordid puzzle, but Pigs at the Trough presents the whole ugly picture of whats really going on for the first timea blistering, wickedly witty portrait of exactly how and why the worst and the greediest are running American business and government into the ground. Tycos Dennis Kozlowski, Adelphias John Rigas, and the Three Horsemen of the Enron ApocalypseKen Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andrew Fastoware not just a few bad apples. They are manifestations of a megatrend in corporate leadershipthe rise of a callous and avaricious mind-set that is wildly out of whack with the core values of the average American. WorldCom, Enron, Adelphia, Tyco, AOL, Xerox, Merrill Lynch, and the other scandals are only the tip of the tip of the corruption iceberg. Making the case that our public watchdogs have become little more than obedient lapdogs, unwilling to bite the corporate hand that feeds them, Arianna Huffington turns the spotlight on the tough reforms we must demand from Washington. We need, she argues, to go way beyond the lame Corporate Responsibility Act if we are to stop the voracious corporate predators from eating away at the very foundations of our democracy. Devastatingly funny and powerfully indicting, Pigs at the Trough is a rousing call to arms and a must-read for all those who are outraged by the scandalous state of corporate America.

 id : 249945 ISBN : 1565848519  | name : Stupidity and Tears  |  description : From the National Book Award-winning author and educator, a book about teaching well in troubled times. A remarkable teacher who discovered in his first teaching assignment that in education he could keep playing with toys, didn't have to stop learning and could use what he knew in the service of others.Lisa Delpit on Herbert Kohl in The New York Times Book Review Teachers, parents, and would-be public-education reformers are battling a failing system. Facing strict budgets and misguided scrutiny, educators are confronted with unprecedented demands and a system that often works against them. Stupidity and Tears, by National Book Award-winning educator Herbert Kohl, is a much-needed call to resistance that offers concrete examples of teaching well under pressure. Kohl's central concern is the importance of teachers' work, both individually and collectively, in the struggle to keep democracy and hope alive at a time when teachers and their students are under siege. Topics discussed include the unflagging pressures of standards-based assessment, the pain teachers feel when asked to teach against their pedagogical conscience or to a high-stakes test, the development of a capacity to sense how students perceive the world, and the strength of the social imagination. Stupidity and Tears is rich with suggestions on developing positive and direct resistance to contemporary forces that threaten social justice.

 id : 249951 ISBN : 1573248703  | name : Mama Says  |  description : Mama Says is a delightful, funny, and very wise book of over 400 sayings from mothers from around the world that represent a lineage of mothers' wisdom. The sayings are not always kind, not always useful, but always true to the intention of teaching young ones how to survive in the world. Many times, it's clear that these sayings are inherited wisdom, received from their mothers who learned it from theirs back into the untraceable past: "Nobody said life was fair." "You don't have anything to lose by asking." "From your mouth to God's ears." "Men only want one thing." Many times, what mama had to say was simply outrageous: "When faced with a room full of horse shit, look for the horse." "There's always something to come along to shorten the tail of the rabbit." "Whatever situation you find yourself in, think of what the Virgin Mary would do and do the same." Mama Says will make anybody laugh out loud remembering what Mom used to say, or smile recognizing how often we end up with the exact same words coming out of our own mouths. After all, "sooner or later, we all quote our mothers."

She also has strange grandparents, with whom she lives, a schizophrenic ventriloquist alcoholic mother who appears and disappears regularly from her life, and only vague information about the father who died before Charlotte was born. With so much craziness in the family, Charlotte figures, whether it's "nature" or "nurture," she's doomed. In Failure to Zigzag, Jane Vandenburgh gracefully zigzags between hilarity and sorrow as she recounts Charlotte's attempts to grow up and to practice "sanity as a form of revenge."

 id : 249971 ISBN : 2253149209  | name : Le diable par la queue  |  description : Avant de connaître la consécration, Paul Auster a connu des années de " galère ", comme tout écrivain qui se refuse à exercer un autre métier. De ses mésaventures, de ses tentatives, de ses véritables paniques devant les soucis matériels, il fait ici la chronique allègre. Elle commence aux querelles budgétaires qui minent le couple de ses parents, et s'achève à la parution de son premier livre. Les admirateurs de l'écrivain apprendront comment il a traduit en direct un discours de Jean Genet, inventé un jeu de cartes qui aurait assuré sa fortune sans l'arrivée de l'informatique, écrit un polar noir dans l'espérance d'un gros tirage... Mais au-delà de l'anecdote, cette réflexion sincère sur l'argent et la création éclaire d'un jour nouveau, de même que les souvenirs réunis sous le titre Pourquoi écrire ?, bien des pages d'une uvre romanesque déjà classique.

Le terme désigne tous les supports, à savoir Internet, CD-Rom et DVD, qui permettent à du texte, des images et du son d'être diffusés simultanément et de façon interactive. * Qui fait du multimédia ? Difficile de cerner avec précision le secteur et le nombre d'emplois. Une certitude : les entreprises sont, pour la plupart, concentrées à Paris, de petite taille et emploient des salariés jeunes, puisque 60 d'entre eux ont moins de 30 ans. * Les entreprises du Net ont-elles encore un avenir ? Certes, les valeurs boursières des sociétés de la netéconomie ont chuté, mais Internet s'est imposé comme un outil d'information et de diffusion irremplaçable. * Quels sont les métiers les plus porteurs ? Webmaster, graphiste, développeur multimédia, chef de projet... ces fonctions sont parmi les plus répandues dans les sociétés multimédias. Mais de nombreux métiers " classiques ", tels que journaliste, traducteur, juriste, musicien, producteur, peuvent aussi s'exercer dans le secteur. * Est-il possible de trouver un emploi sans avoir de connaissances informatiques ? Si les entreprises proposent des fonctions tout à fait classiques (gestionnaire, juriste...), la plupart des postes nécessitent de posséder un minimum de connaissances techniques (langage HTML...). * Comment se former ?

Ce guide vous présente toutes les formations postbac avec les coordonnées des établissements. * Quel niveau d'études viser ? La tendance est à la hausse du niveau d'études, même si vous pouvez encore intégrer le secteur avec un bac+2. Mais n'oubliez pas, les recruteurs privilégient la culture générale et l'aptitude à s'adapter à de nouvelles technologies. * Faut-il se spécialiser ? Selon le domaine dans lequel vous voulez évoluer (création, gestion...), une spécialisation d'un ou deux ans pourra vous aider à vous insérer sur le marché de l'emploi.

Dieses Jahr bleibt er allerdings verschwunden, und so muss niemand Geringerer als Tod für ihn einspringen. In der Zwischenzeit begibt sich seine Enkelin Susanne auf die Suche nach dem Verschollenen ... Terry Pratchett, geboren 1948, fand im zarten Alter von 13 Jahren den ersten Käufer für eine seiner Geschichten. Heute zählt der kleine Mann mit dem grossen schwarzen Schlapphut zu den erfolgreichsten Autoren Grossbritanniens und ist einer der populärsten Fantasy-Autoren der Welt. Seit 1983 schreibt er Scheibenwelt-Romane. Inzwischen widmet er sich ganz seiner Schöpfung, und seine Gemeinde wird täglich grösser. Dabei ist er zweifellos der Autor mit dem skurrilsten ehemaligen Beruf: Er war jahrelang Pressesprecher für fünf Atomkraftwerke beim Central Electricity Generating Board. Nach eigener Auskunft hat er nur deshalb noch kein Buch darüber geschrieben, weil es ihm ja doch keiner glauben würde. Seinen Sinn für Realsatire hat der schrille Job jedenfalls geschärft. Von seinen Scheibenwelt-Romanen wurden weltweit rund 65 Millionen Exemplare verkauft, seine Werke sind in 37 Sprachen übersetzt. Für seine Verdienste um die englische Literatur wurde ihm sogar die Ritterwürde verliehen. Umgeben von den modernsten Computern (und so durch ein Stück Schnur mit dem Rest der Welt verbunden) lebt Terry Pratchett mit seiner Frau Lyn in der englischen Grafschaft Wiltshire.

 id : 249988 ISBN : 3423005424  | name : Es waren Habichte in der Luft  |  description : Als 1951 dieser erste Roman von Siegfried Lenz erschien, war sich die Kritik spontan einig: hier kündigt sich ein Erzähler an, der eine eigene Sprache spricht, eindrucksvoll und unverwechselbar. Der Roman spielt kurz nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg im russisch-finnischen Grenzgebiet. Ein Lehrer versucht nach dem politischen Umsturz seinen Verfolgern zu entgehen. Seine Tarnungsmanöver werden jedoch von den Bewohnern des Grenzdorfes durchschaut. Das Ganze ist so unsentimental scharf und richtig gesehen, so klar profiliert und in der Aktion motiviert, daß man dem jungen Autor Siegfried Lenz einen Platz unter den Hoffnungen unserer jungen erzählenden Literatur einräumen muß. Karl Korn Inzwischen hat Lenz seinen Rang in der deutschen Nachkriegsliteratur durch ein kontinuierlich gewachsenes Werk eindrucksvoll bestätigt.
